== Overview

The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster].

As an {product-title} administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface.  These metrics are also
used by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscalers]
in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics] as a metrics
engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is configured,
CPU, memory and network-based metrics are viewable from the {product-title} web console
and are available for use by xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal
pod autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU, memory and network usage, then exports them into Hawkular
Metrics.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[resource limits] are defined for your
project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The donut chart
displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145 Available of 200
MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

[[cluster-metrics-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your {product-title} installation was originally performed on a version
previous to v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, follow
the instructions for node certificates outlined in
xref:../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[Updating
Master and Node Certificates]. If the node certificate does not contain the IP
address of the node, then Heapster will fail to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the *openshift-infra*
project. This allows xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod
autoscalers] to discover the Heapster service and use it to retrieve metrics
that can be used for autoscaling.

All of the following commands in this topic must be executed under the
*openshift-infra* project. To switch to the *openshift-infra* project:

----
$ oc project openshift-infra
----

To enable cluster metrics, you must next configure the following:

- xref:metrics-service-accounts[Service Accounts]
- xref:metrics-data-storage[Metrics Data Storage]
- xref:metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer]

[[metrics-service-accounts]]
== Service Accounts

You must configure xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service accounts]
for:

* xref:metrics-deployer-service-account[Metrics Deployer]
* xref:heapster-service-account[Heapster]

[[metrics-deployer-service-account]]
=== Metrics Deployer Service Account

The xref:metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer] will be discussed in a later step,
but you must first set up a service account for it:


. Grant view permissions to the Hawkular Metrics service:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:hawkular -n openshift-infra
----

. Create a *metrics-deployer* service account:
+
----
$ oc create -f - <<API
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: metrics-deployer
secrets:
- name: metrics-deployer
API
----

. Before it can deploy components, the *metrics-deployer* service account must
also be granted the `edit` permission for the *openshift-infra* project:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user \
    edit system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer
----

[[heapster-service-account]]
=== Heapster Service Account

The Heapster component requires access to the master server to list all
available nodes and access the `/stats` endpoint for each node. Before it can do
this, the Heapster service account requires the `cluster-reader` permission:

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:heapster
----

[NOTE]
====
The Heapster service account is created automatically during the
xref:deploying-the-metrics-components[Deploying
the Metrics Components] step.
====

[[metrics-data-storage]]
== Metrics Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] or to
a temporary xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[pod volume].

[[metrics-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with persistent storage means that
your metrics will be stored to a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] and be able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is
ideal if you require your metrics data to be guarded from data loss.  For production environments it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage for your metrics pods.

The size of the persisted volume can be specified with the `CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE`
xref:deployer-template-parameters[template
parameter]. By default it is set to 10 GB, which may or may not be sufficient
for the size of the cluster you are using. If you require more space, for
instance 100 GB, you could specify it with something like this:

----
$ oc process -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -v HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    -v CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE=100Gi \
    | oc create -f -
----

The size requirement of the Cassandra storage is dependent on the number of
pods. It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that the size
requirements are sufficient for their setup and to monitor usage to ensure that
the disk does not become full.

If you would like to use xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provisioned persistent volumes]
you must set the `*DYNAMICALLY_PROVISION_STORAGE*`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#modifying-the-deployer-template[template option]
to `true` for the Metrics Deployer.

[[capacity-planning-for-openshift-metrics]]
=== Capacity Planning for Cluster Metrics

After the metrics deployer runs, the output of `oc get pods` should resemble the following:

====
----
 # oc get pods -n openshift-infra
 NAME                                READY             STATUS      RESTARTS          AGE
 hawkular-cassandra-1-l5y4g          1/1               Running     0                 17h
 hawkular-metrics-1t9so              1/1               Running     0                 17h
 heapster-febru                      1/1               Running     0                 17h
----
====

{product-title} metrics are stored using the Cassandra database, which is
deployed with settings of `*MAX_HEAP_SIZE=512M*` and `*NEW_HEAP_SIZE=100M*`.
These values should cover most {product-title} metrics installations, but you
can modify them in the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/cassandra/Dockerfile[Cassandra Dockerfile]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Cassandra Dockerfile
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
prior to deploying cluster metrics.

By default, metrics data is stored for 7 days. You can configure this with the `*METRIC_DURATION*` parameter in the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/metrics.yaml[*_metrics.yaml_* configuration file].
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*_metrics.yaml_* configuration file.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
After seven days, Cassandra begins to purge the oldest metrics data.
Metrics data for deleted pods and projects is not automatically
purged; it is only removed once the data is over seven days old.

[WARNING]
====
If the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space, then data loss
will occur.
====

For cluster metrics to work with persistent storage, ensure that the persistent
volume has the *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. If this mode is not active, then the persistent volume claim cannot locate the persistent volume, and Cassandra fails to start.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent volume] of sufficient size is available. The creation of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent volume claims] is handled by the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-deployer[Metrics Deployer].

{product-title} metrics also supports
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/metrics.yaml#L130[dynamically-provisioned persistent volumes].
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
dynamically-provisioned persistent volumes.
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
To use this feature with {product-title} metrics, it is necessary to add an
additional flag to the metrics-deployer: `DYNAMICALLY_PROVISION_STORAGE=true`.
You can use EBS, GCE, and Cinder storage back-ends to
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provision persistent volumes].

In tests performed with with 210 and 990 {product-title} nodes, where 10500 pods
and 11000 pods were monitored respectively, the Cassandra database grew at the
speed shown in the table below:

.Cassandra Database storage requirements based on number of nodes/pods in the cluster
[options="header"]
|===
|Number of Nodes |Number of Pods |Cassandra Storage growth speed |Cassandra storage growth per day |Cassandra storage growth per week

|210
|10500
|500 MB per hour
|15 GB
|75 GB

|990
|11000
|1 GB per hour
|30 GB
|210 GB
|===

In the above calculation, approximately 20% of the expected size was added as
overhead to ensure that the storage requirements do not exceed calculated value.

If the `METRICS_DURATION` and `METRICS_RESOLUTION` values are kept at the
default (`7` days and `15` seconds respectively), it is safe to plan Cassandra
storage size requrements for week, as in the values above.

[WARNING]
====
Because {product-title} metrics uses the Cassandra database as a datastore for
metrics data, if `USE_PERSISTANT_STORAGE=true` is set during the metrics set up
process, `PV` will be on top in the network storage, with NFS as the default.
However, using network storage in combination with Cassandra is not recommended,
as per the
link:http://docs.datastax.com/en/archived/cassandra/1.2/cassandra/architecture/architecturePlanningAntiPatterns_c.html[Cassandra
documentation].
====

*Known Issues and Limitations*

Testing found that the `heapster` metrics component is capable of handling up to
12000 pods. If the amount of pods exceed that number, Heapster begins to fall
behind in metrics processing, resulting in the possibility of metrics graphs no
longer appearing. Work is ongoing to increase the number of pods that Heapster
can gather metrics on, as well as upstream development of alternate
metrics-gathering solutions.

[[metrics-non-persistent-storage]]
=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that
any stored metrics will be deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much
easier to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with
non-persistent data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However,
metrics can still survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you must set the
`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
xref:modifying-the-deployer-template[template
option] to `false` for the Metrics Deployer.

[NOTE]
====
When using non-persistent storage, metrics data will be written to
*_/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods_* on the node where the Cassandra
pod is running. Ensure *_/var_* has enough free space to accommodate metrics
storage.
====

[[metrics-deployer]]
== Metrics Deployer

The Metrics Deployer deploys and configures all of the metrics components. You
can configure it by passing in information from
xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secrets] and by passing
parameters to the Metrics Deployer's
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[template].

[[metrics-deployer-using-secrets]]
=== Using Secrets

The Metrics Deployer will auto-generate self-signed certificates for use between its
components and will generate a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting route] to expose
the Hawkular Metrics service. This route is what allows the web console to access the Hawkular Metrics
service.

In order for the browser running the web console to trust the connection through this route,
it must trust the route's certificate. This can be accomplished by
xref:metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs[providing your own certificates] signed by a trusted
Certificate Authority. The Metric Deployer's secret allows you to pass your own certificates
which it will then use when creating the route.

If you do not wish to provide your own certificates, the router's default certificate will
be used instead.

[[metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs]]
==== Providing Your Own Certificates

To provide your own certificate which will be used by the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting route],
you can pass these values as
xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secrets] to the Metrics Deployer.

The `hawkular-metrics.pem` value needs to contain the certificate in its *_.pem_*
format. You may also need to provide the certificate for the Certificate Authority
which signed this *_pem_* file via the `hawkular-metrics-ca.cert` secret.

====
----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer \
    hawkular-metrics.pem=/home/openshift/metrics/hm.pem \
    hawkular-metrics-ca.cert=/home/openshift/metrics/hm-ca.cert
----
====

When these secrets are provided, the deployer uses these values to specify the
`key`, `certificate` and `caCertificate` values for the re-encrypting route it generated.

For more information, please see the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encryption
route documentation].


[[metrics-using-secrets-default]]
==== Using the Router's Default Certificate

If the `hawkular-metrics.pem` value is not specified, the re-encrypting route will
use the router's default certificate, which may not be trusted by browsers.

A secret named *metrics-deployer* will still be required in this situation. This
can be considered a "dummy" secret since the secret it specifies is not actually used
by the component.

To create a "dummy" secret that does not specify a certificate value:

----
$ oc secrets new metrics-deployer nothing=/dev/null
----

[[deployer-secret-options]]
==== Deployer Secret Options

The following table contains more advanced configuration options, detailing all
the secrets which can be used by the deployer:

[cols="2,4",options="header"]
|===

|Secret Name |Description

|*_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
|The *_pem_* file to use for the Hawkular Metrics certificate used for the
re-encrypting route. This certificate *must* contain the host name used by the
route (e.g., `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`). The default router's certificate is
used for the route if this option is unspecified.

|*_hawkular-metrics-ca.cert_*
|The certificate for the CA used to sign the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*. This is optional if the *_hawkular-metrics.pem_*
does not contain the CA certificate directly.

|*_heapster.cert_*
|The certificate for Heapster to use. This is auto-generated if unspecified.

|*_heapster.key_*
|The key to use with the Heapster certificate. This is ignored if
*_heapster.cert_* is not specified

|*_heapster_client_ca.cert_*
|The certificate that generates *_heapster.cert_*. This is required if
*_heapster.cert_* is specified.  Otherwise, the main CA for the {product-title}
installation is used. In order for
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly, this should not be overridden.

|*_heapster_allowed_users_*
|A file containing a comma-separated list of CN to accept from certificates
signed with the specified CA. By default, this is set to allow the
{product-title} service proxy to connect.  If you override this, make sure to
add `system:master-proxy` to the list in order to allow
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod autoscaling] to function
properly.

|===

[[modifying-the-deployer-template]]
=== Modifying the Deployer Template

The {product-title}  installer uses a
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-templates[template] to deploy the
metrics components. The default template can be found at the following path:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
/usr/share/openshift/examples/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Depending on your installation method, the template may not be present in your
{product-title} installation. If so, the template can be found at the following GitHub
location:

https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/blob/master/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.2/infrastructure-templates/origin/metrics-deployer.yaml
====

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_hosted_templates/files/v1.4/enterprise/metrics-deployer.yaml
----
endif::[]

In case you need to make any changes to this file, copy it to another directory
with the file name *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* and refer to the new location when
using it in the following sections.

[[deployer-template-parameters]]
==== Deployer Template Parameters

The deployer template parameter options and their defaults are listed in the
default *_metrics-deployer.yaml_* file. If required, you can override these
values when creating the Metrics Deployer.

.Template Parameters
[options="header"]
|===

|Parameter |Description

|`*METRIC_DURATION*`
|The number of days metrics should be stored.

|`*CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE*`
|The persistent volume size for each of the Cassandra nodes.

|`*CASSANDRA_NODES*`
|The number of initial Cassandra nodes to deploy.

|`*USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE*`
|Set to *true* for persistent storage; set to *false* to use non-persistent storage.

|`*DYNAMICALLY_PROVISION_STORAGE*`
|Set to *true* to allow for xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provisioned storage].

|`*REDEPLOY*`
|If set to *true*, the deployer will try to delete all the existing components
before trying to redeploy.

|`*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`
|External host name where clients can reach Hawkular Metrics.  This is the FQDN
of the machine running the router pod.

|`*MASTER_URL*`
|Internal URL for the master, for authentication retrieval.

|`*IMAGE_VERSION*`
|Specify version for metrics components. For example, for
*openshift/origin-metrics-deployer:latest*, set version to *latest*.

|`*IMAGE_PREFIX*`
|Specify prefix for metrics components. For example, for
*openshift/origin-metrics-deployer:latest*, set prefix to *openshift/origin-*.

|`*MODE*`
a|Can be set to:

- *preflight* to perform validation before a deployment.
- *deploy* to perform an initial deployment.
- *refresh* to delete and redeploy all components but to keep persisted data and routes.
- *redeploy* to delete and redeploy everything (losing all data in the process).
- *validate* to re-run validations after a deployment.

|`*IGNORE_PREFLIGHT*`
|Can be set to *true* to disable the preflight checks. This allows the deployer
to continue even if the preflight check has failed.

|`*USER_WRITE_ACCESS*`
|Sets whether user accounts should be able to write metrics. Defaults to `false`
so that only Heapster can write metrics and not individual users. It is
recommended to disable user write access; if enabled, any user will be able to
write metrics to the system which can affect performance and can cause Cassandra
disk usage to unpredictably increase.

|===

The only required parameter is `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*`. This value is
required when creating the deployer, because it specifies the host name for the
Hawkular Metrics xref:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route]. This
value should correspond to a fully qualified domain name. You must know
the value of `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` when
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-setting-the-metrics-public-url[configuring the console] for metrics access.

If you are using
xref:metrics-persistent-storage[persistent
storage] with Cassandra, it is the administrator's responsibility to set a
sufficient disk size for the cluster using the `*CASSANDRA_PV_SIZE*` parameter.
It is also the administrator's responsibility to monitor disk usage to make sure
that it does not become full.

[WARNING]
====
Data loss will result if the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space.
====

All of the other parameters are optional and allow for greater customization.
For instance, if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not
available under *_https://kubernetes.default.svc:443_* you can specify the value
to use instead with the `*MASTER_URL*` parameter. To deploy a specific version
of the metrics components, use the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter.

[WARNING]
====
It is highly recommended to not use *latest* for the *IMAGE_VERSION*. The *latest*
version corresponds to the very latest version available and can cause issues if it brings in a
newer version not meant to function on the version of {product-title} you are currently running.
====

[[deploying-the-metrics-components]]
== Deploying the Metric Components

Because deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled by the
Metrics Deployer, you can simply deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default template parameters. Optionally, you can
specify any of the
xref:deployer-template-parameters[template
parameters] when calling these commands.

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

----
$ oc new-app --as=system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer \
    -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and deploy without persistent storage.

----
$ oc new-app --as=system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer \
    -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    -p USE_PERSISTENT_STORAGE=false
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Because this is being deployed without persistent storage, metric data loss
can occur.
====

[[metrics-deployer-validations]]
=== Metrics Deployer Validations

The metrics deployer does some validation both before and after deployment. If
the pre-flight validation fails, the environment for deployment is considered
unsuitable and the deployment is aborted. However, you can add
`*IGNORE_PREFLIGHT=true*` to the deployer parameters if you believe the
validation has erred.

If post-deployment validation fails, the deployer finishes in an *Error* state,
which indicates that you should check the deployer logs for issues that may
require addressing.  For example, the validation may detect that the external
*hawkular-metrics* route is not actually in use, because the route was already
created somewhere else. The validation output at the end of a deployment should
explain as clearly as possible any issues it finds and what you can do to
address them.

Once you have addressed deployment validation issues, you can re-run just the
validation by running the deployer again with the `*MODE=validate*` parameter
added, for example:

----
$ oc new-app --as=system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:metrics-deployer \
    -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
    -p MODE=validate
----

There is also a diagnostic for metrics:

----
$ oadm diagnostics MetricsApiProxy
----

[[install-setting-the-metrics-public-url]]
== Setting the Metrics Public URL

The {product-title} web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics
service to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics
service must be configured via the `*metricsPublicURL*` option in the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*). This URL
corresponds to the route created with the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` template
parameter during the
xref:deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `*HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME*` corresponds to
`hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file:

====
[source,yaml,]
----
  assetConfig:
    ...
    metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the *_master-config.yaml_* file, you must
restart your {product-title} instance.

When your {product-title} server is back up and running, metrics will be
displayed on the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics
service is hosted under a different host name and uses different certificates
than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `*metricsPublicURL*` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by
your browser.
====

[[cluster-metrics-accessing-hawkular-metrics-directly]]
== Accessing Hawkular Metrics Directly

To access and manage metrics more directly, use the Hawkular Metrics API.

[NOTE]
====
When accessing Hawkular Metrics via the API, you will only be able to perform
reads. Writing metrics has been disabled by default. If you want for individual
users to also be able to write metrics, you must set the
`*USER_WRITE_ACCESS*`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deployer-template-parameters[deployer template parameter]
to *true*.

However, it is recommended to use the default configuration and only have
metrics enter the system via Heapster. If write access is enabled, any user
will be able to write metrics to the system, which can affect performance and
cause Cassandra disk usage to unpredictably increase.
====

The link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[Hawkular Metrics documentation]
covers how to use the API, but there are a few differences when dealing with the
version of Hawkular Metrics configured for use on {product-title}:

[[cluster-metrics-openshift-projects-and-hawkular-tenants]]
=== {product-title} Projects and Hawkular Tenants

Hawkular Metrics is a multi-tenanted application. It is configured so that a
project in {product-title} corresponds to a tenant in Hawkular Metrics.

As such, when accessing metrics for a project named *MyProject* you must set the
link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#_tenant_header[*Hawkular-Tenant*]
header to *MyProject*.

There is also a special tenant named *_system* which contains system level
metrics. This requires either a *cluster-reader* or *cluster-admin* level
privileges to access.

[[cluster-metrics-authorization]]
=== Authorization

The Hawkular Metrics service will authenticate the user against {product-title}
to determine if the user has access to the project it is trying to access.

Hawkular Metrics accepts a bearer token from the client and verifies that token
with the {product-title} server using a *SubjectAccessReview*. If the user has
proper read privileges for the project, they are allowed to read the metrics
for that project. For the *_system* tenant, the user requesting to read from
this tenant must have *cluster-reader* permission.

When accessing the Hawkular Metrics API, you must pass a bearer token in the
*Authorization* header.

== Accessing Heapster Directly

Heapster has been configured to be only accessible via the
xref:../rest_api/kubernetes_v1.adoc#proxy-get-requests-to-service[API proxy].
Accessing it will required either a cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to access the Heapster *validate* page, you need to access it
using something similar to:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/validate
----

For more information about Heapster and how to access its APIs, please refer the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/[Heapster] project.

[[cluster-metrics-scaling-openshift-metrics-pods]]
== Scaling {product-title} Metrics Pods

One set of metrics pods (Cassandra/Hawkular/Heapster) is able to monitor at
least 10,000 pods.

[CAUTION]
====
Pay attention to system load on nodes where {product-title} metrics pods run.
Use that information to determine if it is necessary to scale out a number of
{product-title} metrics pods and spread the load across multiple {product-title}
nodes. Scaling {product-title} metrics heapster pods is not recommended.
====

[[cluster-metrics-scaling-pods-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

If persistent storage was used to deploy {product-title} metrics, then you must
xref:../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[create a persistent volume (PV)]
for the new Cassandra pod to use before you can scale out the number of
{product-title} metrics Cassandra pods. However, if Cassandra was deployed with
dynamically provisioned PVs, then this step is not necessary.

[[cluster-metrics-scaling-pods-cassandra]]
=== Scaling the Cassandra Components

The Cassandra nodes use persistent storage, therefore scaling up or down is not possible with replication controllers.

Scaling a Cassandra cluster requires you to use the `hawkular-cassandra-node` template. By default, the Cassandra cluster is a single-node cluster.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To add a second node with 10Gi of storage:

----
# oc process hawkular-cassandra-node-pv \
    -v IMAGE_PREFIX=openshift/origin- \
    -v IMAGE_VERSION=devel \
    -v PV_SIZE=10Gi \
    -v NODE=2
----

To deploy more nodes, simply increase the `NODE` value.
endif::openshift-origin[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To scale out the number of {product-title} metrics hawkular pods to two
replicas, run:

----
# oc scale -n openshift-infra --replicas=2 rc hawkular-metrics
----
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

[NOTE]
====
If you add a new node to a Cassandra cluster, the data stored in the cluster
rebalances across the cluster. The same thing happens If you remove a node from
the Cluster.

[[cluster-metrics-horizontal-pod-autoscaling]]
== Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

{product-title} version 3.3 does not provide
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[Horizontal
Pod Autoscaling (HPA)] support for metrics pods and scaling metrics pods.

[[metrics-cleanup]]
== Cleanup

You can remove everything deloyed by the metrics deployer by performing the
following steps:

----
$ oc delete all,sa,templates,secrets,pvc --selector="metrics-infra"
----

To remove the deployer components, perform the following steps:

----
$ oc delete sa,secret metrics-deployer
----
