== Overview

The
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in back-ends by
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster[Heapster].

As an {product-title} administrator, you can view a cluster's metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface. These metrics are also used by
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod
autoscalers] in order to determine when and how to scale.

This topic describes using
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics[Hawkular Metrics] as a metrics
engine which stores the data persistently in a
link:http://cassandra.apache.org/[Cassandra] database. When this is configured,
CPU, memory and network-based metrics are viewable from the {product-title} web
console and are available for use by
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod
autoscalers].

Heapster retrieves a list of all nodes from the master server, then contacts
each node individually through the `/stats` endpoint. From there, Heapster
scrapes the metrics for CPU, memory and network usage, then exports them into
Hawkular Metrics.

The storage volume metrics available on the kubelet are not available through
the `/stats` endpoint, but are available through the `/metrics` endpoint. See
xref:../install_config/prometheus_cluster_monitoring.adoc#prometheus-cluster-monitoring[Prometheus Monitoring] for detailed information.

Browsing individual pods in the web console displays separate sparkline charts
for memory and CPU. The time range displayed is selectable, and these charts
automatically update every 30 seconds. If there are multiple containers on the
pod, then you can select a specific container to display its metrics.

If xref:../admin_guide/limits.adoc#admin-guide-limits[resource limits] are
defined for your project, then you can also see a donut chart for each pod. The
donut chart displays usage against the resource limit. For example: `145
Available of 200 MiB`, with the donut chart showing `55 MiB Used`.

[[cluster-metrics-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[WARNING]
====
If your {product-title} installation was originally performed on a version
previous to v1.0.8, even if it has since been updated to a newer version, follow
the instructions for node certificates outlined in
xref:../upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#manual-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating
Master and Node Certificates]. If the node certificate does not contain the IP
address of the node, then Heapster fails to retrieve any metrics.
====
endif::[]

An Ansible playbook is available to deploy and upgrade cluster metrics. You
should familiarize yourself with the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[Installing Clusters] guide. This
provides information for preparing to use Ansible and includes information about
configuration. Parameters are added to the Ansible inventory file to configure
various areas of cluster metrics.

The following describe the various areas and the parameters that can be added to
the Ansible inventory file in order to modify the defaults:

- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-namespace[Metrics Project]
- xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-data-storage[Metrics Data Storage]

[[metrics-namespace]]
== Metrics Project

The components for cluster metrics must be deployed to the *openshift-infra*
project in order for autoscaling to work.
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[Horizontal pod
autoscalers] specifically use this project to discover the Heapster service and
use it to retrieve metrics. The metrics project can be changed by adding
`openshift_metrics_project` to the inventory file.

[[metrics-data-storage]]
== Metrics Data Storage

You can store the metrics data to either
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] or to a temporary xref:../dev_guide/volumes.adoc#dev-guide-volumes[pod
volume].

[[metrics-persistent-storage]]
=== Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with persistent storage means that your
metrics are stored to a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent
volume] and are able to survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal
if you require your metrics data to be guarded from data loss. For production
environments it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage for your
metrics pods.

The size requirement of the Cassandra storage is dependent on the number of
pods. It is the administrator's responsibility to ensure that the size
requirements are sufficient for their setup and to monitor usage to ensure that
the disk does not become full. The size of the persisted volume claim is
specified with the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[ansible
variable] which is set to 10 GB by default.

If you would like to use xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provisioned persistent volumes] set the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to `dynamic` in the inventory file.

[[capacity-planning-for-openshift-metrics]]
=== Capacity Planning for Cluster Metrics

After running the `openshift_metrics` Ansible role, the output of `oc get pods`
should resemble the following:

----
 # oc get pods -n openshift-infra
 NAME                                READY             STATUS      RESTARTS          AGE
 hawkular-cassandra-1-l5y4g          1/1               Running     0                 17h
 hawkular-metrics-1t9so              1/1               Running     0                 17h
 heapster-febru                      1/1               Running     0                 17h
----

{product-title} metrics are stored using the Cassandra database, which is
deployed with settings of `openshift_metrics_cassandra_limits_memory: 2G`; this
value could be adjusted further based upon the available memory as determined by
the Cassandra start script. This value should cover most {product-title} metrics
installations, but using environment variables you can modify the `MAX_HEAP_SIZE`
along with heap new generation size, `HEAP_NEWSIZE`, in the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/cassandra/Dockerfile[Cassandra Dockerfile]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Cassandra Dockerfile
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
prior to deploying cluster metrics.

By default, metrics data is stored for seven days. After seven days, Cassandra
begins to purge the oldest metrics data. Metrics data for deleted pods and
projects is not automatically purged; it is only removed once the data is more
than seven days old.

.Data Accumulated by 10 Nodes and 1000 Pods
====
In a test scenario including 10 nodes and 1000 pods, a 24 hour period
accumulated 2.5 GB of metrics data. Therefore, the capacity planning formula for
metrics data in this scenario is:

(((2.5 × 10^9^) ÷ 1000) ÷ 24) ÷ 10^6^ = ~0.125 MB/hour per pod.
====

.Data Accumulated by 120 Nodes and 10000 Pods
====
In a test scenario including 120 nodes and 10000 pods, a 24 hour period
accumulated 25 GB of metrics data. Therefore, the capacity planning formula for
metrics data in this scenario is:

(((11.410 × 10^9^) ÷ 1000) ÷ 24) ÷ 10^6^ = 0.475 MB/hour
====

|===
| |1000 pods| 10000 pods

|Cassandra storage data accumulated over 24 hours (default metrics parameters)
|2.5 GB
|11.4 GB
|===

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
These two test cases are presented on the following graph:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekuric/openshift/master/metrics/1_10kpods.png[1000 pods versus 10000 pods monitored during 24 hours]
endif::openshift-origin[]

If the default value of 7 days for `openshift_metrics_duration` and 30 seconds for
`openshift_metrics_resolution` are preserved, then weekly storage requirements for the Cassandra pod would be:

|===
| |1000 pods | 10000 pods

|Cassandra storage data accumulated over seven days (default metrics parameters)
|20 GB
|90 GB
|===

In the previous table, an additional 10 percent was added to the expected
storage space as a buffer for unexpected monitored pod usage.

[WARNING]
====
If the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space, then data loss
occurs.
====

For cluster metrics to work with persistent storage, ensure that the persistent
volume has the *ReadWriteOnce* access mode. If this mode is not active, then the
persistent volume claim cannot locate the persistent volume, and Cassandra fails
to start.

To use persistent storage with the metric components, ensure that a
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volumes[persistent volume] of
sufficient size is available. The creation of
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[persistent volume claims] is handled by
the OpenShift Ansible `openshift_metrics` role.

{product-title} metrics also supports dynamically-provisioned persistent volumes.
To use this feature with {product-title} metrics, it is necessary to set the value
of `openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type` to `dynamic`.
You can use EBS, GCE, and Cinder storage back-ends to
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[dynamically provision persistent volumes].

For information on configuring the performance and scaling the cluster metrics
pods, see the
xref:../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_metrics.adoc#scaling-performance-cluster-metrics[Scaling
Cluster Metrics] topic.

[discrete]
[[cluster-metrics-known-issues-and-limitations]]
==== Known Issues and Limitations

Testing found that the `heapster` metrics component is capable of handling up to
25,000 pods. If the amount of pods exceed that number, Heapster begins to fall
behind in metrics processing, resulting in the possibility of metrics graphs no
longer appearing. Work is ongoing to increase the number of pods that Heapster
can gather metrics on, as well as upstream development of alternate
metrics-gathering solutions.

[[metrics-non-persistent-storage]]
=== Non-Persistent Storage

Running {product-title} cluster metrics with non-persistent storage means that
any stored metrics are deleted when the pod is deleted. While it is much
easier to run cluster metrics with non-persistent data, running with
non-persistent data does come with the risk of permanent data loss. However,
metrics can still survive a container being restarted.

In order to use non-persistent storage, you must set the
`openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to `emptydir` in the inventory file.

[NOTE]
====
When using non-persistent storage, metrics data is written to
*_/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes/pods_* on the node where the Cassandra
pod runs Ensure *_/var_* has enough free space to accommodate metrics
storage.
====

[[metrics-ansible-role]]
== Metrics Ansible Role

The {product-title} Ansible `openshift_metrics` role configures and deploys all of the
metrics components using the variables from the
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Configuring
Ansible] inventory file.

[[metrics-ansible-variables]]
=== Specifying Metrics Ansible Variables

The `openshift_metrics` role included with OpenShift Ansible defines the tasks
to deploy cluster metrics. The following is a list of role variables that can be
added to your inventory file if it is necessary to override them.

.Ansible Variables

xref:../admin_guide/scheduling/node_selector.adoc#admin-guide-sched-selector[node selector] to ensure that
pods are placed onto nodes with specific labels. For example,
`{"node-role.kubernetes.io/infra":"true"}`.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_allowed_users`
|A comma-separated list of CN to accept. By default, this is set to allow the
OpenShift service proxy to connect. Add `system:master-proxy` to the list when
overriding in order to allow
xref:../dev_guide/pod_autoscaling.adoc#dev-guide-pod-autoscaling[horizontal pod
autoscaling] to function properly.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_limits_memory`
|The amount of memory to limit the Heapster pod. For example, a value of `2Gi`
would limit the Heapster pod to 2 GB of memory.

|`openshift_metrics_heapster_limits_cpu`

|`openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname`
|Set when executing the `openshift_metrics` Ansible role, since it uses the host
name for the Hawkular Metrics xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[route].
This value should correspond to a fully qualified domain name.
|===

See xref:../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-compute-resources[Compute
Resources] for further discussion on how to specify requests and limits.

If you are using
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-persistent-storage[persistent
storage] with Cassandra, it is the administrator's responsibility to set a
sufficient disk size for the cluster using the `openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size` variable.
It is also the administrator's responsibility to monitor disk usage to make sure
that it does not become full.

[WARNING]
====
Data loss results if the Cassandra persisted volume runs out of sufficient space.
====

All of the other variables are optional and allow for greater customization.
For instance, if you have a custom install in which the Kubernetes master is not
available under `\https://kubernetes.default.svc:443` you can specify the value
to use instead with the `openshift_metrics_master_url` parameter.

[[metrics-using-secrets]]
=== Using Secrets

The {product-title} Ansible `openshift_metrics` role auto-generates self-signed certificates for use between its
components and generates a
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting route] to expose
the Hawkular Metrics service. This route is what allows the web console to access the Hawkular Metrics
service.

In order for the browser running the web console to trust the connection through
this route, it must trust the route's certificate. This can be accomplished by
xref:metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs[providing your own certificates] signed by
a trusted Certificate Authority. The `openshift_metrics` role allows you to
specify your own certificates, which it then uses when creating the route.

The router's default certificate are used if you do not provide your own.

[[metrics-using-secrets-byo-certs]]
==== Providing Your Own Certificates

To provide your own certificate, which is used by the
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encrypting
route], you can set the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_cert`,
`openshift_metrics_hawkular_key`, and `openshift_metrics_hawkular_ca`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variables]
in your inventory file.

The `hawkular-metrics.pem` value needs to contain the certificate in its *_.pem_*
format. You may also need to provide the certificate for the Certificate Authority
which signed this *_pem_* file via the `hawkular-metrics-ca.cert` secret.

For more information, see the
xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#secured-routes[re-encryption
route documentation].

[[deploying-the-metrics-components]]
== Deploying the Metric Components

Because deploying and configuring all the metric components is handled with
{product-title} Ansible, you can deploy everything in one step.

The following examples show you how to deploy metrics with and without
persistent storage using the default parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The host that you run the Ansible playbook on must have at least 75MiB of free
memory per host in the inventory.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
In accordance with upstream Kubernetes rules, metrics can be collected only on the default interface of `eth0`.
====

.Deploying with Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and is deployed using persistent storage.

You must have a persistent volume of sufficient size available.

----
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/playbooks/openshift-metrics/config.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=True \
   -e openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.example.com \
   -e openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=pv
----
====

.Deploying without Persistent Storage
====
The following command sets the Hawkular Metrics route to use
*hawkular-metrics.example.com* and deploy without persistent storage.

----
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/playbooks/openshift-metrics/config.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=True \
   -e openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=hawkular-metrics.example.com
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Because this is being deployed without persistent storage, metric data loss
can occur.
====

[[metrics-diagnostics]]
=== Metrics Diagnostics

The are some diagnostics for metrics to assist in evaluating the state of the
metrics stack. To execute diagnostics for metrics:

----
$ oc adm diagnostics MetricsApiProxy
----

[[install-setting-the-metrics-public-url]]
== Setting the Metrics Public URL

The {product-title} web console uses the data coming from the Hawkular Metrics
service to display its graphs. The URL for accessing the Hawkular Metrics
service must be configured with the `metricsPublicURL` option in the
xref:../install_config/web_console_customization.adoc#install-config-web-console-customization[master
webconsole-config configmap file].
This URL corresponds to the route created with the
`openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` inventory variable used during the
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[deployment]
of the metrics components.

[NOTE]
====
You must be able to resolve the `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` from the browser
accessing the console.
====

For example, if your `openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname` corresponds to
`hawkular-metrics.example.com`, then you must make the following change in the
webconsole-config configmap file:

====
[source,yaml]
----
clusterInfo:
  ...
  metricsPublicURL: "https://hawkular-metrics.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
====

Once you have updated and saved the webconsole-config configmap file, you must
restart your {product-title} instance.

When your {product-title} server is back up and running, metrics are displayed on the pod overview pages.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are using self-signed certificates, remember that the Hawkular Metrics
service is hosted under a different host name and uses different certificates
than the console. You may need to explicitly open a browser tab to the value
specified in `metricsPublicURL` and accept that certificate.

To avoid this issue, use certificates which are configured to be acceptable by
your browser.
====

[[cluster-metrics-accessing-hawkular-metrics-directly]]
== Accessing Hawkular Metrics Directly

To access and manage metrics more directly, use the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics/blob/master/docs/hawkular_metrics.adoc#accessing-metrics-using-hawkular-metrics[Hawkular
Metrics API].

[NOTE]
====
When accessing Hawkular Metrics from the API, you are only able to perform
reads. Writing metrics is disabled by default. If you want individual
users to also be able to write metrics, you must set the
`openshift_metrics_hawkular_user_write_access`
xref:../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#metrics-ansible-variables[variable]
to *true*.

However, it is recommended to use the default configuration and only have
metrics enter the system via Heapster. If write access is enabled, any user
can write metrics to the system, which can affect performance and
cause Cassandra disk usage to unpredictably increase.
====

The link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[Hawkular Metrics documentation]
covers how to use the API, but there are a few differences when dealing with the
version of Hawkular Metrics configured for use on {product-title}:

[[cluster-metrics-openshift-projects-and-hawkular-tenants]]
=== {product-title} Projects and Hawkular Tenants

Hawkular Metrics is a multi-tenanted application. It is configured so that a
project in {product-title} corresponds to a tenant in Hawkular Metrics.

As such, when accessing metrics for a project named *MyProject* you must set the
link:http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html#_tenant_header[*Hawkular-Tenant*]
header to *MyProject*.

There is also a special tenant named *_system* which contains system level
metrics. This requires either a *cluster-reader* or *cluster-admin* level
privileges to access.

[[cluster-metrics-authorization]]
=== Authorization

The Hawkular Metrics service authenticates the user against {product-title}
to determine if the user has access to the project it is trying to access.

Hawkular Metrics accepts a bearer token from the client and verifies that token
with the {product-title} server using a *SubjectAccessReview*. If the user has
proper read privileges for the project, they are allowed to read the metrics
for that project. For the *_system* tenant, the user requesting to read from
this tenant must have *cluster-reader* permission.

When accessing the Hawkular Metrics API, you must pass a bearer token in the
*Authorization* header.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[cluster-metrics-accessing-heapster-directly]]
== Accessing Heapster Directly

Heapster is configured to only be accessible via the API proxy. Accessing
Heapster requires either a cluster-reader or cluster-admin privileges.

For example, to access the Heapster *validate* page, you need to access it
using something similar to:

----
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" \
       -X GET https://${KUBERNETES_MASTER}/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/openshift-infra/services/https:heapster:/validate
----

== Scaling {product-title} Cluster Metrics Pods

Information about scaling cluster metrics capabilities is available in the
xref:../scaling_performance/scaling_cluster_metrics.adoc#cluster-metrics-scaling-openshift-metrics-pods[Scaling and
Performance Guide].

[[metrics-cleanup]]
== Cleanup

You can remove everything deployed by the {product-title} Ansible `openshift_metrics` role
by performing the following steps:

----
$ ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory>] <OPENSHIFT_ANSIBLE_DIR>/playbooks/openshift-metrics/config.yml \
   -e openshift_metrics_install_metrics=False
