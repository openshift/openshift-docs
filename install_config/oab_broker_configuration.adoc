== Overview

When the
xref:../architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.adoc#arch-ansible-service-broker[OpenShift
Ansible broker] (OAB) is deployed in a cluster, its behavior is largely dictated
by the broker's configuration file loaded on startup. The broker's configuration
is stored as a ConfigMap object in the broker's namespace
(*{oab-ns}* by default).

== Modifying the OpenShift Ansible Broker Configuration

To modify the OAB's default broker configuration after it has been deployed:

. Edit the *broker-config* ConfigMap object in the OAB's namespace as a user
with *cluster-admin* privileges:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc edit configmap broker-config -n {oab-ns}
----

. After saving any updates, redeploy the OAB's deployment configuration for the
changes to take effect:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc rollout latest dc/asb -n {oab-ns}
----

[[oab-config-registry]]
== Registry Configuration

The `registry` section allows you to define the registries that the broker should look at
for APBs.

.`registry` Section Configuration Options
[options="header",cols="1,3,1"]
|===

|Field |Description |Required

|`name`
|The name of the registry. Used by the broker to identify APBs from this registry.
|Y

|`user`
|The user name for authenticating to the registry. Not used when `auth_type` is
set to `secret` or `file`.
|N

|`pass`
|The password for authenticating to the registry. Not used when `auth_type` is
set to `secret` or `file`.
|N

|`auth_type`
|How the broker should read the registry credentials if they are not defined in
the broker configuration via `user` and `pass`. Can be `secret` (uses a secret
in the broker namespace) or `file` (uses a mounted file).
|N

|`auth_name`
|Name of the secret or file storing the registry credentials that should be read.
Used when `auth_type` is set to `secret`.
|N, only required when `auth_type` is set to `secret` or `file`.


|`org`
|The namespace or organization that the image is contained in.
|N

|`type`
|The type of registry. Available adapters are `mock`, `rhcc`, `openshift`,
`dockerhub`, and `local_openshift`.
|Y

|`namespaces`
|The list of namespaces to configure the `local_openshift` registry type with. By default, a user should use `openshift`.
|N

|`url`
|The URL that is used to retrieve image information. Used extensively for RHCC while the `dockerhub` type uses hard-coded URLs.
|N

|`fail_on_error`
|Should this registry fail, the bootstrap request if it fails. Will stop the execution of other registries loading.
|N

|`white_list`
|The list of regular expressions used to define which image names should be allowed through. Must have a white list to allow APBs to be added to the catalog. The most permissive regular expression that you can use is `.*-apb$` if you would want to retrieve all APBs in a registry. See xref:oab-config-apb-filtering[APB Filtering] for more details.
|N

|`black_list`
|The list of regular expressions used to define which images names should never be allowed through. See xref:oab-config-apb-filtering[APB Filtering] for more details.
|N

|`images`
|The list of images to be used with an OpenShift Container Registry.
|N

[[oab-config-registry-prod-dev]]
=== Production or Development

A _production_ broker configuration is designed to be pointed at a trusted
container distribution registry, such as the Red Hat Container Catalog (RHCC):

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: rhcc
    type: rhcc
    url: https://registry.redhat.io
    tag: v3.11
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
  - type: local_openshift
    name: localregistry
    namespaces:
      - openshift
    white_list: []
----

However, a _development_ broker configuration is primarily used by developers
working on the broker. To enable developer settings, set the registry name to
`dev` and the `dev_broker` field in the `broker` section to `true`:

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  name: dev
----

[source,yaml]
----
broker:
  dev_broker: true
----

[[oab-config-registry-storing-creds]]
=== Storing Registry Credentials

The broker configuration determines how the broker should read any registry
credentials. They can be read from the `user` and `pass` values in the
`registry` section, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: isv
    type: openshift
    url: https://registry.connect.redhat.com
    user: <user>
    pass: <password>
----

If you want to ensure these credentials are not publicly accessible, the
`auth_type` field in the `registry` section can be set to the `secret` or `file`
type. The `secret` type configures a registry to use a secret from the broker's
namespace, while the `file` type configures a registry to use a secret that has
been mounted as a volume.

To use the `secret` or `file` type:

. The associated secret should have the values `username` and `password` defined.
When using a secret, you must ensure that the `{oab-ns}`
namespace exists, as this is where the secret will be read from.
+
For example, create a *_reg-creds.yaml_* file:
+
----
$ cat reg-creds.yaml
---
username: <user_name>
password: <password>
----

. Create a secret from this file in the `{oab-ns}`
namespace:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc create secret generic \
    registry-credentials-secret \
    --from-file reg-creds.yaml \
    -n {oab-ns}
----

. Choose whether you want to use the `secret` or `file` type:
+
--
- To use the `secret` type:

.. In the broker configuration, set `auth_type` to
`secret` and `auth_name` to the name of the secret:
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: isv
    type: openshift
    url: https://registry.connect.redhat.com
    auth_type: secret
    auth_name: registry-credentials-secret
----

.. Set the namespace where the secret is located:
+
[subs=attributes+]
[source,yaml]
----
openshift:
  namespace: {oab-ns}
----

- To use the `file` type:

.. Edit the `asb` deployment configuration to mount your file into
*_/tmp/registry-credentials/reg-creds.yaml_*:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc edit dc/asb -n {oab-ns}
----
+
In the `containers.volumeMounts` section, add:
+
[source,yaml]
----
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /tmp/registry-credentials
    name: reg-auth
----
+
In the `volumes` section, add:
+
[source,yaml]
----
    volumes:
      - name: reg-auth
        secret:
          defaultMode: 420
          secretName: registry-credentials-secret
----

.. In the broker configuration, set `auth_type` to `file` and `auth_type` to the
location of the file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: isv
    type: openshift
    url: https://registry.connect.redhat.com
    auth_type: file
    auth_name: /tmp/registry-credentials/reg-creds.yaml
----
--

[[oab-config-apb-filtering]]
=== APB Filtering

APBs can be filtered out by their image name using a combination of the
`white_list` or `black_list` parameters, set on a registry basis inside the
broker's configuration.

Both are optional lists of regular expressions that will be run over the total
set of discovered APBs for a given registry to determine matches.

.APB Filter Behavior
[options="header"]
|===

|Present |Allowed |Blocked

|Only whitelist
|Matches a regex in list.
|Any APB that does not match.

|Only blacklist
|All APBs that do not match.
|APBs that match a regex in list.

|Both present
|Matches regex in whitelist but not in blacklist.
|APBs that match a regex in blacklist.

|None
|No APBs from the registry.
|All APBs from that registry.
|===

For example:

.Whitelist Only
[source,yaml]
----
white_list:
  - "foo.*-apb$"
  - "^my-apb$"
----

Anything matching on `foo.*-apb$` and only `my-apb` will
be allowed through in this case. All other APBs will be rejected.

.Blacklist Only
[source,yaml]
----
black_list:
  - "bar.*-apb$"
  - "^foobar-apb$"
----

Anything matching on `bar.*-apb$` and only `foobar-apb` will be blocked in this
case. All other APBs will be allowed through.

.Whitelist and Blacklist
[source,yaml]
----
white_list:
  - "foo.*-apb$"
  - "^my-apb$"
black_list:
  - "^foo-rootkit-apb$"
----

Here, `foo-rootkit-apb` is specifically blocked by the blacklist despite its
match in the whitelist because the whitelist match is overridden.

Otherwise, only those matching on `foo.*-apb$` and `my-apb` will be allowed
through.

.Example Broker Configuration `registry` Section:
[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - type: dockerhub
    name: dockerhub
    url: https://registry.hub.docker.com
    user: <user>
    pass: <password>
    org: <org>
    white_list:
      - "foo.*-apb$"
      - "^my-apb$"
    black_list:
      - "bar.*-apb$"
      - "^foobar-apb$"
----

[[oab-config-registry-mock]]
=== Mock Registry

A mock registry is useful for reading local APB specs. Instead of going out to a
registry to search for image specs, this uses a list of local specs. Set the
name of the registry to `mock` to use the mock registry.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: mock
    type: mock
----

[[oab-config-registry-dockerhub]]
=== Dockerhub Registry

The `dockerhub` type allows you to load APBs from a specific organization in
the DockerHub. For example, the
link:https://hub.docker.com/u/ansibleplaybookbundle/[*ansibleplaybookbundle*]
organization.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: dockerhub
    type: dockerhub
    org: ansibleplaybookbundle
    user: <user>
    pass: <password>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

[[oab-config-registry-galaxy]]
=== Ansible Galaxy Registry

The `galaxy` type allows you to use APB roles from
link:https://galaxy.ansible.com[Ansible Galaxy]. You can also optionally
specify an organization.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: galaxy
    type: galaxy
    # Optional:
    # org: ansibleplaybookbundle
    runner: docker.io/ansibleplaybookbundle/apb-base:latest
    white_list:
      - ".*$"
----

[[oab-config-registry-local]]
=== Local OpenShift Container Registry

Using the `local_openshift` type will allow you to load APBs from the
OpenShift Container Registry that is internal to the {product-title} cluster.
You can configure the namespaces in which you want to look for published APBs.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - type: local_openshift
    name: lo
    namespaces:
      - openshift
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

[[oab-config-registry-rhcc]]
=== Red Hat Container Catalog Registry

Using the `rhcc` type will allow you to load APBs that are published to the
link:https://access.redhat.com/containers[Red Hat Container Catalog] (RHCC)
registry.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: rhcc
    type: rhcc
    url: https://registry.redhat.io
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

[[oab-config-partner-registry]]
=== Red Hat Connect Partner Registry

Third-party images in the Red Hat Container Catalog are served from the Red Hat
Connect Partner Registry at link:https://registry.connect.redhat.com[]. The
`partner_rhcc` type allows the broker to be bootstrapped from the Partner
Registry to retrieve a list of APBs and load their specs. The Partner Registry
requires authentication for pulling images with a valid Red Hat Customer Portal
user name and password.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: partner_reg
    type: partner_rhcc
    url:  https://registry.connect.redhat.com
    user: <registry_user>
    pass: <registry_password>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

Because the Partner Registry requires authentication, the following manual step
is also required to configure the broker to use the Partner Registry URL:

. Run the following command on all nodes of a {product-title} cluster:
+
----
# docker --config=/var/lib/origin/.docker \
    login -u <registry_user> -p <registry_password> \
    registry.connect.redhat.com
----

[[oab-config-helm-chart-registry]]
=== Helm Chart Registry

Using the `helm` type allows you to consume Helm Charts from a Helm Chart Repository.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: stable
    type: helm
    url: "https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com"
    runner: "docker.io/automationbroker/helm-runner:latest"
    white_list:
      - ".*"
----

NOTE: A heavy percentage of helm charts from the stable repository are not well suited for OpenShift.
See the link:https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/helm2bundle/wiki/Known-Issues[Known Issues] for more information.

[[oab-config-api-v2-registry]]
=== API V2 Docker Registry

Using the `apiv2` type allows you to consume images from docker registries that implement the Docker Registry
HTTP API V2 protocol.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: <registry_name>
    type: apiv2
    url:  <registry_url>
    user: <registry-user>
    pass: <registry-password>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

If the registry requires authentication for pulling images, this can be achieved by running the following
command on every node in your existing cluster:

----
$ docker --config=/var/lib/origin/.docker login -u <registry-user> -p <registry-password> <registry_url>
----

[[oab-config-quay-registry]]
=== Quay Docker Registry

Using the `quay` type allows you to load APBs that are published to the link:https://quay.io/about/[CoreOS Quay Registry].
If an authentication token is provided, private repositories that the token is configured to access will load.
Public repositories in the specified organization do not require a token to load.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: quay_reg
    type: quay
    url:  https://quay.io
    token: <for_private_repos>
    org: <your_org>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

If the Quay registry requires authentication for pulling images, this can be achieved by running the following
command on every node in your existing cluster:

----
$ docker --config=/var/lib/origin/.docker login -u <registry-user> -p <registry-password> quay.io
----

[[oab-configmultiple-registries]]
=== Multiple Registries

You can use more than one registry to separate APBs into logical organizations
and be able to manage them from the same broker. The registries must have a
unique, non-empty name. If there is no unique name, the service broker will fail
to start with an error message alerting you to the problem.

[source,yaml]
----
registry:
  - name: dockerhub
    type: dockerhub
    org: ansibleplaybookbundle
    user: <user>
    pass: <password>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
  - name: rhcc
    type: rhcc
    url: <rhcc_url>
    white_list:
      - ".*-apb$"
----

[[oab-config-auth]]
== Broker Authentication

The broker supports authentication, meaning when connecting to the broker, the
caller must supply the Basic Auth or Bearer Auth credentials for each request.
Using `curl`, it is as simple as supplying:

----
-u <user_name>:<password>
----

or

----
-h "Authorization: bearer <token>
----

to the command. The service catalog must be configured with a secret containing
the user name and password combinations or the bearer token.

[[oab-config-basic-auth]]
=== Basic Auth

To enable Basic Auth usage, set the following in the broker configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
broker:
   ...
   auth:
     - type: basic <1>
       enabled: true <2>
----
<1> The `type` field specifies the type of authentication to use.
<2> The `enabled` field allows you to disable a particular authentication type. This
keeps you from having to delete the entire section of `auth` just to disable it.

[[oab-config-basic-auth-deployment-template-secrets]]
==== Deployment Template and Secrets

Typically the broker is configured using a
xref:../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap] in a
deployment template. You supply the authentication configuration the same way as
in the file configuration.

The following is an example of the link:https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/master/templates/deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml#L220-L222[deployment template]:

[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  - type: basic
    enabled: ${ENABLE_BASIC_AUTH}
----

Another part to Basic Auth is the user name and password used to authenticate
against the broker. While the Basic Auth implementation can be backed by
different back-end services, the currently supported one is backed by a _secret_.
The secret must be injected into the pod via a volume mount at the
*_/var/run/asb_auth_* location. This is from where the broker will read the user
name and password.

In the
link:https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/61a7fc80e40a7d7ddd836a2216394185094b1b0b/templates/deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml#L168-L175[deployment template],
a secret must be specified. For example:

[subs=attributes+]
[source,yaml]
----
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: asb-auth-secret
    namespace: {oab-ns}
  data:
    username: ${BROKER_USER}
    password: ${BROKER_PASS}
----

The secret must contain a user name and password. The values must be base64
encoded. The easiest way to generate the values for those entries is to use the
`echo` and `base64` commands:

[source,bash]
----
$ echo -n admin | base64 <1>
YWRtaW4=
----
<1> The `-n` option is very important.

This secret must now be injected to the pod via a volume mount. This is
configured in the deployment template as well:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  serviceAccount: asb
  containers:
  - image: ${BROKER_IMAGE}
    name: asb
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
    volumeMounts:
      ...
      - name: asb-auth-volume
        mountPath: /var/run/asb-auth
----

Then, in the `volumes` section, mount the secret:

[source,yaml]
----
volumes:
  ...
  - name: asb-auth-volume
    secret:
      secretName: asb-auth-secret
----

The above will have created a volume mount located at *_/var/run/asb-auth_*.
This volume will have two files: a user name and password written by the
*asb-auth-secret* secret.

[[oab-config-basic-auth-service-catalog-broker-communication]]
==== Configuring Service Catalog and Broker Communication

Now that the broker is configured to use Basic Auth, you must tell the service
catalog how to communicate with the broker. This is accomplished by the
`authInfo` section of the broker resource.

The following is an example of creating a `broker` resource in the service
catalog. The `spec` tells the service catalog what URL the broker is listening
at. The `authInfo` tells it what secret to read to get the authentication
information.

[subs=attributes+]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: ansible-service-broker
spec:
  url: https://asb-1338-{oab-ns}.172.17.0.1.nip.io
  authInfo:
    basicAuthSecret:
      namespace: {oab-ns}
      name: asb-auth-secret
----

Starting with v0.0.17 of the service catalog, the broker resource configuration
changes:

[subs=attributes+]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceBroker

  authInfo:
    basic:
      secretRef:
        namespace: {oab-ns}
        name: asb-auth-secret
----

[[oab-config-bearer-auth]]
=== Bearer Auth

By default, if no authentication is specified the broker will use bearer token
authentication (Bearer Auth). Bearer Auth uses delegated authentication from the
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/apiserver[Kubernetes *apiserver*] library.

The configuration grants access, through
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/[Kubernetes RBAC] roles
and role bindings, to the URL prefix. The broker has added a configuration
option `cluster_url` to specify the `url_prefix`. This value defaults to
`{oab-ns}`.

.Example Cluster Role
[source,yaml]
----
- apiVersion: authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    name: access-asb-role
  rules:
  - nonResourceURLs: ["/ansible-service-broker", "/ansible-service-broker/*"]
    verbs: ["get", "post", "put", "patch", "delete"]
----

[[oab-config-bearer-auth-deployment-secrets]]
==== Deployment Template and Secrets

The following is an example of creating a secret that the service catalog can
use. This example assumes that the role, *access-asb-role*, has been created
already. From the
link:https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/blob/61a7fc80e40a7d7ddd836a2216394185094b1b0b/templates/deploy-ansible-service-broker.template.yaml#L224-L248[deployment template]:

[subs=attributes+]
[source,yaml]
----
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ServiceAccount
  metadata:
    name: ansibleservicebroker-client
    namespace: {oab-ns}

- apiVersion: authorization.openshift.io/v1
  kind: ClusterRoleBinding
  metadata:

  metadata:
    name: ansibleservicebroker-client
    annotations:
      kubernetes.io/service-account.name: ansibleservicebroker-client
  type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
----

The above example creates a service account, granting access to
*access-asb-role* and
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/service-accounts-admin/[creating a secret]
for that service accounts token.

[NOTE]
====
Async bind and unbind is an experimental feature and is not supported or enabled
by default. With the absence of async bind, setting `launch_apb_on_bind` to
`true` can cause the bind action to timeout and will span a retry. The broker
will handle this with "409 Conflicts" because it is the same bind request with
different parameters.
====

[[oab-config-secrets]]
== Secrets Configuration

The `secrets` section creates associations between secrets in the broker's
namespace and APBs the broker runs. The broker uses these rules to mount secrets
into running APBs, allowing the user to use secrets to pass parameters without
exposing them to the catalog or users.

The section is a list where each entry has the following structure:

[options="header",cols="1,3,1"]
|===

|Field |Description |Required

|`title`
|The title of the rule. This is just for display and output purposes.
|Y

|`apb_name`
|The name of the APB to associate with the specified secret. This is the fully
qualified name (`<registry_name>-<image_name>`).
|Y

|`secret`
|The name of the secret to pull parameters from.
|Y
|===

You can download and use the

[[configuring-oab-proxy]]
== Running Behind a Proxy

When running the OAB inside of a proxied {product-title} cluster, it is
important to understand its core concepts and consider them within the context
of a proxy used for external network access.

As an overview, the broker itself runs as a pod within the cluster. It has a
requirement for external network access depending on how its registries have
been configured.

[[configuring-oab-proxy-adapter-whitelists]]
=== Registry Adapter Whitelists

The broker's configured registry adapters must be able to communicate with their
external registries in order to bootstrap successfully and load remote APB
manifests. These requests can be made via the proxy, however, the proxy must
ensure that the required remote hosts are accessible.

Example required whitelisted hosts:

[options="header"]
|===
|Registry Adapter Type |Whitelisted Hosts

|`rhcc`
|`registry.redhat.io`, `access.redhat.com`

|`dockerhub`
|`docker.io`
|===

[[configuring-oab-proxy-ansible]]
=== Configuring the Broker Behind a Proxy Using Ansible

If during initial installation you configure your {product-title} cluster to run
behind a proxy (see
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-global-proxy[Configuring Global Proxy Options]), when the OAB is deployed it will:

- inherit those cluster-wide proxy settings automatically and
- generate the required `NO_PROXY` list, including the `cidr` fields  and `serviceNetworkCIDR`,

and no further configuration is needed.

[[configuring-oab-proxy-manually]]
=== Configuring the Broker Behind a Proxy Manually

If your cluster's global proxy options were not configured during initial
installation or prior to the broker being deployed, or if you have modified the
global proxy settings, you must manually configure the broker for external
access via proxy:

. Before attempting to run the OAB behind a proxy, review
xref:../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#install-config-http-proxies[Working
with HTTP Proxies] and ensure your cluster is configured accordingly to run
behind a proxy.
+
In particular, the cluster must be configured to _not_ proxy internal cluster
requests. This is typically configured with a `NO_PROXY` setting of:
+
----
.cluster.local,.svc,<serviceNetworkCIDR_value>,<master_IP>,<master_domain>,.default
----
+
in addition to any other desired `NO_PROXY` settings. See
xref:../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#configuring-no-proxy[Configuring
NO_PROXY] for more details.
+
[NOTE]
====
Brokers deploying unversioned, or v1 APBs _must_ also add `172.30.0.1` to their
`NO_PROXY` list. APBs prior to v2 extracted their credentials from running APB
pods via an `exec` HTTP request, rather than a secret exchange. Unless you are
running a broker with experimental proxy support in a cluster prior to
{product-title} 3.9, you probably do not have to worry about this.
====

. Edit the broker's `DeploymentConfig` as a user with *cluster-admin* privileges:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc edit dc/asb -n {oab-ns}
----

. Set the following environment variables:
+
--
- `HTTP_PROXY`
- `HTTPS_PROXY`
- `NO_PROXY`
--
+
[NOTE]
====
See
xref:../install_config/http_proxies.adoc#setting-environment-variables-in-pods[Setting Proxy Environment Variables in Pods] for more information.
====

. After saving any updates, redeploy the OAB's deployment configuration for the
changes to take effect:
+
[subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc rollout latest dc/asb -n {oab-ns}
----

[[configuring-oab-proxy-pods]]
=== Setting Proxy Environment Variables in Pods

It is common that APB pods themselves may require external access via proxy as
well. If the broker recognizes it has a proxy configuration, it will
transparently apply these environment variables to the APB pods that it spawns.
As long as the modules used within the APB respect proxy configuration via
environment variable, the APB will also use these settings to perform its work.

Finally, it is possible the services spawned by the APB may also require
external network access via proxy. The APB _must_ be authored to set these
environment variables explicitly if recognizes them in its own execution
environment, or the cluster operator must manually modify the required services
to inject them into their environments.
