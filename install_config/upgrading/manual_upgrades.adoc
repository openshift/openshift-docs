== Overview

As an alternative to performing an
link:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.html[automated upgrade],
you can manually upgrade your OpenShift cluster. To manually upgrade without
disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as documented in this
topic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself now with the entire
procedure. link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may
require additional steps] to be performed at key points before or during the
standard upgrade process.

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, perform the following
steps:

. On each master and node host, manually disable the 3.0 channel and enable the
3.1 channel:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, perform the following
steps:
endif::[]

. Create an *etcd* backup on each master:
+
----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----

. Remove support for the *v1beta3* API. Update the
*_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master, and remove
*v1beta3* from the `*apiLevels*` and `*kubernetesMasterConfig.apiLevels*`
parameters.

. During this upgrade, some directories are renamed from *openshift* to
*origin*, so create the following symlinks on each host:
+
----
# ln -s /var/lib/openshift /var/lib/origin
# ln -s /etc/openshift /etc/origin
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you are already running OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 or later, create an *etcd*
backup by running:
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 or later, create an *etcd* backup
by running:
endif::[]

----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----

For any upgrade path, always ensure that you are running the latest kernel:

----
# yum update kernel
----

[[upgrading-masters]]
== Upgrading Masters
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master*
package:

----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1:

. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
====
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
====
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----
====

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-master* service and review its
logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# journalctl -r -u origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the
*atomic-openshift-master* package:

----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift-master
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1:

. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
====
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
====
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----
====

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-master
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-master* service and
review its logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default
cluster roles] may have been updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy using the following process:

. Reconcile the cluster roles:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

. Restart the master service:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]

. Reconcile the cluster roles again to pick up new capabilities:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

. Reconcile the cluster role bindings:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-role-bindings \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated:oauth \
    --exclude-groups=system:unauthenticated \
    --exclude-users=system:anonymous \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

For each node that is not also a master, disable scheduling before you upgrade
them:

====
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
On each node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:

----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:

----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-node* service:

----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
On each node host, upgrade all *atomic-openshift* packages:

----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\*
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:

----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-node
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]

Enable scheduling again for any non-master nodes that you disabled:

====
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=true
----
====

As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, verify that all nodes are showing as
*Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS
master.example.com      kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com     Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready
node2.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com      Ready
----
====

[[upgrading-the-router]]
== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
link:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.html[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
link:../../admin_guide/high_availability.html#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.1.6 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry.
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[Deploying
a Docker Registry] details how to configure persistent storage for the registry.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.1.6 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
By default, the link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced
installation] method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp
templates, and database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a
default project to which all users have view access. These objects were created
during installation from the JSON files located under
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*.

To update these objects, first ensure that you have the latest
*openshift-ansible* code checked out, which provides the example JSON files:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
By default, the link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick] and
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
methods automatically create default image streams, InstantApp templates, and
database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a default
project to which all users have view access. These objects were created during
installation from the JSON files located under the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/_*
directory.

To update these objects, first update the packages that provide the example JSON
files. On a master host, install or update to the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

The *openshift-ansible-roles* package provides the latest example JSON files.
endif::[]

Now update the global *openshift* project by running the following commands as a
user with *cluster-admin* privileges. It is expected that you will receive
warnings about items that already exist.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
# oc create -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json
# oc create -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/db-templates

[[importing-the-latest-images]]
== Importing the Latest Images

After link:#updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates[updating the
default image streams], you may also want to ensure that the images within those
streams are updated. For each image stream in the default *openshift* project,
you can run:

----
# oc import-image -n openshift <imagestream>
----

For example, get the list of all image streams in the default *openshift*
project:

[[updating-master-and-node-certificates]]
== Updating Master and Node Certificates

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The following steps may be required for any OpenShift cluster that was
originally installed prior to the
link:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.html[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
release]. This may include any and all updates from that version.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The following steps may be required for any OpenShift cluster that was
originally installed prior to the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.8 release].
This may include any and all updates from that version.
endif::[]

[[updating-node-certificates]]
=== Node Certificates

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
With the 3.1 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated to
include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before the
3.1 release may not contain the IP address of the node.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated
to include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before
the 1.0.8 release may not contain the IP address of the node.
endif::[]

If a node is missing the IP address as part of its certificate, clients may
refuse to connect to the kubelet endpoint. Usually this will result in errors
regarding the certificate not containing an `IP SAN`.

In order to remedy this situation, you may need to manually update the
certificates for your node.

[[checking-the-nodes-certificate]]
==== Checking the Node's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the node's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mynode*, *mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*:

====
----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/node/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mynode, DNS:mynode.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----
====

Ensure that the `*nodeIP*` value set in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file is present in the IP values from the
Subject Alternative Names listed in the node's serving certificate. If the
`*nodeIP*` is not present, then it will need to be added to the node's
certificate.

If the `*nodeIP*` value is already contained within the Subject Alternative
Names, then no further steps are required.

You will need to know the Subject Alternative Names and `*nodeIP*` value for the
following steps.

[[generating-a-new-node-certificate]]
==== Generating a New Node Certificate

If your current node certificate does not contain the proper IP address, then
you must regenerate a new certificate for your node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Node certificates will be regenerated on the master (or first master) and are
then copied into place on node systems.
====

. Create a temporary directory in which to perform the following steps:
+
----
# mkdir /tmp/node_certificate_update
# cd /tmp/node_certificate_update
----

. Export the signing options:
+
----
# export signing_opts="--signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt"
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=<existing_SANs>,<nodeIP>
----
+
For example, if the Subject Alternative Names from before were *mynode*,
*mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*, and the `*nodeIP*` was 10.10.10.1, then
you would need to run the following command:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=mynode,mynode.mydomain.com,1.2.3.4,10.10.10.1
----

[[replace-node-serving-certificates]]
==== Replace Node Serving Certificates

Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/node/server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/node/server.key_* files for your node:

----
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key.bak
----

You must now copy the new *_server.crt_* and *_server.key_* created in the
temporary directory during the previous step:

----
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key
----

After you have replaced the node's certificate, restart the node service:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

[[updating-master-certificates]]
=== Master Certificates

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
With the 3.1 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 3.1 release may not contain these additional
service names.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 1.0.8 release may not contain these additional
service names.
endif::[]

[[checking-the-masters-certificate]]
==== Checking the Master's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the master's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mymaster*, *mymaster.mydomain.com*, and
*1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mymaster, DNS:mymaster.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the following entries are present in the Subject Alternative Names
for the master's serving certificate:

[options="header"]
|===
|Entry |Example

|Kubernetes service IP address
|172.30.0.1

|All master host names
|*master1.example.com*

|All master IP addresses
|192.168.122.1

|Public master host name in clustered environments
|*public-master.example.com*

|*kubernetes*
|

|*kubernetes.default*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*
|

|*openshift*
|

|*openshift.default*
|

|*openshift.default.svc*
|

|*openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*
|
|===

If these names are already contained within the Subject Alternative Names, then
no further steps are required.

[[generating-a-new-master-certificate]]
==== Generating a New Master Certificate

If your current master certificate does not contain all names from the list
above, then you must generate a new certificate for your master:

. Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/master/master.server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/master/master.server.key_* files for your master:

. Export the service names. These names will be used when generating the new
certificate:
+
----
# export service_names="kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,openshift,openshift.default,openshift.default.svc,openshift.default.svc.cluster.local"

. You will need the first IP in the services
subnet (the *kubernetes* service IP) as well as the values of `*masterIP*`,
`*masterURL*` and `*publicMasterURL*` contained in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file for the following steps.
+
The *kubernetes* service IP can be obtained with:
+
----
# oc get svc/kubernetes --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
====
----
# oadm ca create-master-certs \

      --public-master=<public_master_address> \ <5>
      --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
      --overwrite=false
----
<1> Adjust `<master_hostnames>` to match your master host name. In a clustered
environment, add all master host names.
<2> Adjust `<master_IP_addresses>` to match the value of `*masterIP*`. In a
clustered environment, add all master IP addresses.
<3> Adjust `<kubernetes_service_IP>` to the first IP in the *kubernetes*
services subnet.
<4> Adjust `<internal_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterURL*`.
<5> Adjust `<public_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterPublicURL*`.
====

. Restart master services. For single master deployments:

== Additional Manual Steps Per Release

Some OpenShift releases may have additional instructions specific to that
release that must be performed to fully apply the updates across the cluster.
Read through the following sections carefully depending on your upgrade path, as
you may be required to perform certain steps at key points during the standard
upgrade process described earlier in this topic.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
See the link:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.html[OpenShift Enterprise
3.1 Release Notes] to review the latest release notes.

[[manual-step-ose-3-1-0]]
=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0

There are no additional manual steps for these releases that are not already
mentioned inline during the link:#manual-upgrades[standard manual upgrade
process].

[[manual-step-ose-3-1-1]]
=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1

There is currently a known issue where new routers created with OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1.1 require public access to port 1936 due to a newly created
liveness probe. Ensure you have added `iptables` rules and cloud network
security rules allowing access to your node's public IP on port 1936:

----
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 1936 -j ACCEPT
# service iptables save
----

If this port is not allowed, the router pod will fail to start after
installation.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[openshift-origin-1-1-0]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.1.0

There are no additional manual steps for this release that are not already
mentioned inline during the link:#manual-upgrades[standard manual upgrade
process].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
link:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.html[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
====
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
link:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.html#using-the-container-network-stack[using
the container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

====
----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
====
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`
endif::[]
