== Overview

As an alternative to performing an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated upgrade],
you can manually upgrade your OpenShift cluster. To manually upgrade without
disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as documented in this
topic.

Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself now with the entire
procedure. xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may
require additional steps] to be performed at key points before or during the
standard upgrade process.

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

[NOTE]
====
If you are on OpenShift Enterprise 3.0, you must first upgrade to 3.1 before
upgrading to 3.2. Further, if you are currently using the Pacemaker HA method,
you must first upgrade to the native HA method before upgrading to 3.2, as the
Pacemaker method is no longer supported starting with 3.2. See the
https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/install_config/upgrading/index.html[OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1 upgrade documentation] for instructions.
====

To prepare for a manual upgrade, follow these steps:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 to 3.2, manually disable the
3.1 channel and enable the 3.2 channel on each host:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.2-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms"
----
+
On RHEL 7 systems, also clear the *yum* cache:
+
----
# yum clean all
----
endif::openshift-enterprise[]

. Install or update to the latest available version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which provides files
that will be used in later sections:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----
+
Because RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems cannot use *yum*, you must download the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on a subscribed RHEL 7 system and copy the
following file to any RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems to be used later:
+
----
/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/files/nuke_images.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This file was previously located at
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/docker/files/nuke_images.sh_*.
====

. Create an *etcd* backup on each master. The *etcd* package is required, even if
using embedded etcd, for access to the `etcdctl` command to make the backup. The
package is installed by default for RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems. If the master is
a RHEL 7 system, ensure the package is installed:
+
----
# yum install etcd
----
+
Then, create the backup:
+
----
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd.bak.<date> <1>
----
<1> Set the date of the backup in `<date>`, or some unique identifier. The command
will not make a backup if the `--backup-dir` location already exists.

. For any upgrade path, ensure that you are running the latest kernel on
each RHEL 7 system:
+
----
# yum update kernel
----

[[upgrading-masters]]
== Upgrading Master Components
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Upgrade your masters first:

. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, create the following
master proxy client certificates:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.
Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master
----

. For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-master* service and review its
logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# journalctl -r -u origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Upgrade your master hosts first:

. Upgrade the *atomic-openshift* packages or related images.

.. For masters using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\*
----

.. For masters using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter to the version you are upgrading to
in the following files:
+
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* (single master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_* (multi-master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_* (multi-master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_*
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-openvswitch_*
+
For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=v3.2.1.9
----

. Restart the master service(s) on each master and review logs to ensure they
restart successfully.
+
For single master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master
----
+
For multi-master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-api
----

. Because masters also have node components running on them in order to be
configured as part of the OpenShift SDN, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and
*openvswitch* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

endif::[]

Upgrade any external etcd hosts using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system:

. Upgrade the *etcd* package:
+
----
# yum update etcd
----

. Restart the *etcd* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart etcd
# journalctl -r -u etcd
----

If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.10,
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
such as {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 or 3.2.0 to 3.2.1,
endif::[]
you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker 1.10:

[IMPORTANT]
====
The node component on masters is set by default to unschedulable status during
initial installation, so that pods are not deployed to them. However, it is
possible to set them schedulable during the initial installation or manually
thereafter. If any of your masters are also configured as a schedulable node,
skip the following Docker upgrade steps for those masters and instead run all
steps described in xref:upgrading-nodes[Upgrading Nodes] when you get to that
section for those hosts as well.
====

. Run the following script on each master and external etcd host to remove all
containers and images, which is required to avoid a long upgrade process for
older images after Docker is updated. Containers and images for pods backed by
replication controllers will be recreated automatically:
+
----
# chmod u+x /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/files/nuke_images.sh
# /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/files/nuke_images.sh
----

. Upgrade Docker.

.. For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

.. For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
[NOTE]
====
If upgrading to RHEL Atomic Host 7.2.5, this upgrades Docker to version 1.10.
See the
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-3-2-1-1-enhancements[{product-title}
3.2.1.1 release notes] for details and known issues.
====
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----
+
After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

During the upgrade, it can sometimes be useful to take a master out of rotation
since some DNS client libraries will not properly to the other masters for
cluster DNS. In addition to stopping the master and controller services, you
can remove the EndPoint from the Kubernetes service's `*subsets.addresses*`.

----
$ oc edit ep/kubernetes -n default
----

When the master is restarted, the Kubernetes service will be automatically
updated.

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] may be updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

[WARNING]
====
If you have customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify those customized roles, annotate them with `openshift.io/reconcile-protect`
set to `true`. Doing so means you are responsible for manually updating those roles with
any new or required permissions during upgrades.
====

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy using the following process:

. Reconcile the cluster roles:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

. Reconcile the cluster role bindings:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-role-bindings \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated:oauth \
    --exclude-groups=system:unauthenticated \
    --exclude-users=system:anonymous \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

. Reconcile the cluster roles again to pick up new capabilities:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

One at at time for each node that is not also a master, you must disable
scheduling and evacuate its pods to other nodes, then upgrade packages and
restart services.

. As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, disable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----

. Evacuate pods on the node to other nodes:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--force` option deletes any pods that are not backed by a replication
controller.
====
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --evacuate --force
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On the node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on the node host:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

. For any upgrade path, restart the *origin-node* service:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Upgrade the node component packages or related images.

.. For nodes using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\*
----

.. For nodes using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter in the
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openvswitch_*
files to the version you are upgrading to. For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=v3.2.1.9
----

. Restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and *openvswitch* services and review the
logs to ensure they restart successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
----
endif::[]

. If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.10,
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
such as {product-title} 3.1 to 3.2 or 3.2.0 to 3.2.1,
endif::[]
you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker 1.10:

.. Run the following script to remove all containers and images, which is required
to avoid a long upgrade process for older images after Docker is updated.
Containers and images for pods backed by replication controllers will be
recreated automatically:
+
----
# chmod u+x /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/files/nuke_images.sh
# /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/common/openshift-cluster/upgrades/files/nuke_images.sh
----

.. Upgrade Docker.

... For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----
+
After Docker is restarted, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service again and
review the logs to ensure it restarts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

... For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
[NOTE]
====
If upgrading to RHEL Atomic Host 7.2.5, this upgrades Docker to version 1.10.
See the
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_2_release_notes.adoc#ose-3-2-1-1-enhancements[{product-title}
3.2.1.1 release notes] for details and known issues.
====
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----
+
After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

. Re-enable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable
----

. Repeat these steps on the next node, and continue repeating these steps until
all nodes have been upgraded.

After all nodes have been upgraded, as a user with *cluster-admin* privileges,
verify that all nodes are showing as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS

[[upgrading-the-router]]
== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
xref:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.adoc#install-config-install-deploy-router[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.2.1.9 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry.
xref:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#storage-for-the-registry[Deploying
a Docker Registry] details how to configure persistent storage for the registry.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.2.1.9 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[enforcing-quota-in-the-registry]]
=== Enforcing Quota in the Registry

Quota must be enforced to prevent layer blobs that exceed the size limit from
being written to the registry's storage. This can be achieved via a
xref:../install/docker_registry.adoc#registry-configuration-reference[configuration
file]:
====
----
...
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        enforcequota: true
...
----
====

Alternatively, use the `*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA*`
environment variable, which is set to `*true*` for the new registry deployments
by default. Existing deployments need to be modified using:

----
# oc env dc/docker-registry REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA=true
----

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp
templates, and database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a
default project to which all users have view access. These objects were created
during installation from the JSON files located under
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*.

To update these objects, first ensure that you have the latest
*openshift-ansible* code checked out, which provides the example JSON files:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods automatically create default image streams, InstantApp templates, and
database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a default
project to which all users have view access. These objects were created during
installation from the JSON files located under the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/_*
directory.

[NOTE]
====
Because RHEL Atomic Host 7 cannot use *yum* to update packages, the following
steps must take place on a RHEL 7 system.
====

To update these objects, first update the packages that provide the example JSON
files. On a subscribed RHEL 7 system where you can run the CLI as a user with
*cluster-admin* permissions, install or update to the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

The *openshift-ansible-roles* package provides the latest example JSON files.
endif::[]

Now, update the global *openshift* project by running the following commands.
Receiving warnings about items that already exist is expected.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[importing-the-latest-images]]
== Importing the Latest Images

After xref:updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates[updating the
default image streams], you may also want to ensure that the images within those
streams are updated. For each image stream in the default *openshift* project,
you can run:

----
# oc import-image -n openshift <imagestream>

== Updating Master and Node Certificates

The following steps may be required for any OpenShift cluster that was
originally installed prior to the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.8 release].
This may include any and all updates from that version.

[id='{sect}-updating-node-certificates']
=== Node Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated
to include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before
the 1.0.8 release may not contain the IP address of the node.

If a node is missing the IP address as part of its certificate, clients may
refuse to connect to the kubelet endpoint. Usually this will result in errors
regarding the certificate not containing an `IP SAN`.

In order to remedy this situation, you may need to manually update the
certificates for your node.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-nodes-certificate']
==== Checking the Node's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the node's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mynode*, *mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*:

====
----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/node/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mynode, DNS:mynode.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----
====

Ensure that the `*nodeIP*` value set in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file is present in the IP values from the
Subject Alternative Names listed in the node's serving certificate. If the
`*nodeIP*` is not present, then it will need to be added to the node's
certificate.

If the `*nodeIP*` value is already contained within the Subject Alternative
Names, then no further steps are required.

You will need to know the Subject Alternative Names and `*nodeIP*` value for the
following steps.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-node-certificate']
==== Generating a New Node Certificate

If your current node certificate does not contain the proper IP address, then
you must regenerate a new certificate for your node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Node certificates will be regenerated on the master (or first master) and are
then copied into place on node systems.
====

. Create a temporary directory in which to perform the following steps:
+
----
# mkdir /tmp/node_certificate_update
# cd /tmp/node_certificate_update
----

. Export the signing options:
+
----
# export signing_opts="--signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt"
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=<existing_SANs>,<nodeIP>
----
+
For example, if the Subject Alternative Names from before were *mynode*,
*mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*, and the `*nodeIP*` was 10.10.10.1, then
you would need to run the following command:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=mynode,mynode.mydomain.com,1.2.3.4,10.10.10.1
----

[id='{sect}-replace-node-serving-certificates']
==== Replace Node Serving Certificates

Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/node/server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/node/server.key_* files for your node:

----
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key.bak
----

You must now copy the new *_server.crt_* and *_server.key_* created in the
temporary directory during the previous step:

----
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key
----

After you have replaced the node's certificate, restart the node service:

----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----

[id='{sect}-updating-master-certificates']
=== Master Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 1.0.8 release may not contain these additional
service names.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-masters-certificate']
==== Checking the Master's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the master's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mymaster*, *mymaster.mydomain.com*, and
*1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mymaster, DNS:mymaster.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the following entries are present in the Subject Alternative Names
for the master's serving certificate:

[options="header"]
|===
|Entry |Example

|Kubernetes service IP address
|172.30.0.1

|All master host names
|*master1.example.com*

|All master IP addresses
|192.168.122.1

|Public master host name in clustered environments
|*public-master.example.com*

|*kubernetes*
|

|*kubernetes.default*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*
|

|*openshift*
|

|*openshift.default*
|

|*openshift.default.svc*
|

|*openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*
|
|===

If these names are already contained within the Subject Alternative Names, then
no further steps are required.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-master-certificate']
==== Generating a New Master Certificate

If your current master certificate does not contain all names from the list
above, then you must generate a new certificate for your master:

. Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/master/master.server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/master/master.server.key_* files for your master:
+
----
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.key /etc/origin/master/master.server.key.bak
----

. Export the service names. These names will be used when generating the new
certificate:
+
----
# export service_names="kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,openshift,openshift.default,openshift.default.svc,openshift.default.svc.cluster.local"
----

. You will need the first IP in the services
subnet (the *kubernetes* service IP) as well as the values of `*masterIP*`,
`*masterURL*` and `*publicMasterURL*` contained in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file for the following steps.
+
The *kubernetes* service IP can be obtained with:
+
----
# oc get svc/kubernetes --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
====
----
# oadm ca create-master-certs \
      --hostnames=<master_hostnames>,<master_IP_addresses>,<kubernetes_service_IP>,$service_names \ <1> <2> <3>
      --master=<internal_master_address> \ <4>
      --public-master=<public_master_address> \ <5>
      --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
      --overwrite=false
----
<1> Adjust `<master_hostnames>` to match your master host name. In a clustered
environment, add all master host names.
<2> Adjust `<master_IP_addresses>` to match the value of `*masterIP*`. In a
clustered environment, add all master IP addresses.
<3> Adjust `<kubernetes_service_IP>` to the first IP in the *kubernetes*
services subnet.
<4> Adjust `<internal_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterURL*`.
<5> Adjust `<public_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterPublicURL*`.
====

. Restart master services. For single master deployments:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
----
+
For native HA multiple master deployments:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api
# systemctl restart origin-master-controllers
----
+
After the service restarts, the certificate update is complete.

[[manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack]]
== Upgrading the EFK Logging Stack

Use the following to upgrade an
xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[already-deployed EFK logging
stack].

[NOTE]
====
The following steps apply when upgrading from {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.1 to 1.2.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.1 to 3.2, or are applying an asynchronous update to 3.2. These steps pull
the latest 3.2 logging images.
endif::[]
====

. Ensure you are working in the project where the EFK stack was previously
deployed. For example, if the project is named *logging*:
+
----
$ oc project logging
----

. Scale down your Fluentd instances to 0:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-fluentd --replicas=0
----
+
Wait until they have terminated. This helps prevent loss of data by giving them
time to properly flush their current buffer and send any logs they were
processing to Elasticsearch.

. Scale down your Kibana instances:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=0
----
+
If you have an operations deployment, also run:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana-ops --replicas=0
----

. Once confirming your Fluentd and Kibana pods have been terminated, scale down
the Elasticsearch pods:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-<unique_name> --replicas=0
----
+
If you have an operations deployment, also run:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-ops-<unique_name> --replicas=0
----

. After confirming your Elasticsearch pods have been terminated, rerun the
deployer to generate any missing or changed features.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
.. xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Re-deploy
the EFK Stack]. After the deployer completes, re-attach the persistent volumes
you were previously using.
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
.. Follow the first step in
xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Deploying
the EFK Stack]. After the deployer completes,
re-attach the persistent volume claims you were previously using, then deploy a
template that is created by the deployer:
+
----
$ oc process logging-support-template | oc apply -f -
----

. Deployment of logging components is intended to happen automatically
based on tags being imported into the image streams created in the previous
step. However, as not all tags are automatically imported, this mechanism
has become unreliable as multiple versions are released. Therefore,
manual importing may be necessary as follows.
+
For each image stream `logging-auth-proxy`, `logging-kibana`,
`logging-elasticsearch`, and `logging-fluentd`, manually import the
tag corresponding to the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` specified (or defaulted)
for the deployer.
+
----
$ oc import-image <name>:<version> --from <prefix><name>:<tag>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ oc import-image logging-auth-proxy:3.2.1 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-auth-proxy:3.2.1
$ oc import-image logging-kibana:3.2.1 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-kibana:3.2.1
$ oc import-image logging-elasticsearch:3.2.1 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-elasticsearch:3.2.1
$ oc import-image logging-fluentd:3.2.1 \
     --from registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/logging-fluentd:3.2.1
----

endif::openshift-enterprise[]

. Next, scale Elasticsearch back up incrementally so that the cluster has time
to rebuild.

.. To begin, scale up to 1:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-<unique_name> --replicas=1
----
+
Follow the logs of the resulting pod to ensure that it is able to recover its
indices correctly and that there are no errors:
+
----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----
+
If that is successful, you can then do the same for the operations cluster, if
one was previously used.

.. After all Elasticsearch nodes have recovered their indices, continue to scale it
back up to the size it was prior to doing maintenance. Check the logs of the
Elasticsearch members to verify that they have correctly joined the cluster and
recovered.

. Now scale Kibana and Fluentd back up to their previous state. Because Fluentd
was shut down and allowed to push its remaining records to Elasticsearch in the
previous steps, it can now pick back up from where it left off with no loss of
logs, provided any unread log files are still available on the node.

. In the latest version, Kibana will display indices differently now in order
to prevent users from being able to access the logs of previously created
projects that have been deleted.
+
Due to this change, your old logs will not appear automatically. To migrate your
old indices to the new format, rerun the deployer with `-v MODE=migrate` in addition
to your prior flags. This should be run while your Elasticsearch cluster is running, as the
script must connect to it to make changes.
+
[NOTE]
====
This only impacts non-operations logs. Operations logs will appear the same as
in previous versions. There should be minimal performance impact to
Elasticsearch while running this and it will not perform an install.
====

[[manual-upgrading-cluster-metrics]]
== Upgrading Cluster Metrics

After upgrading an
xref:../../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#install-config-cluster-metrics[already-deployed Cluster Metrics install],
you must update to a newer version of the metrics components.

- The update process stops all the metrics containers,
updates the metrics configuration files,
and redeploys the newer components.

- It does not change the metrics route.

- It does not delete the metrics persistent volume claim.
Metrics stored to persistent volumes before the update
are available after the update completes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The update deletes all non-persisted metric values
and overwrites local changes to the metrics configurations.
For example, the number of instances in a replica set is not saved.
====

To update, follow the same steps as when the metrics components were
xref:../../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#deploying-the-metrics-components[first deployed],
using the
xref:../../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#modifying-the-deployer-template[correct template],
except this time, specify the `MODE=refresh` option:

====
----
$ oc new-app -f metrics-deployer.yaml \
    -p HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME=hm.example.com,MODE=refresh <1>
----
<1> In the original deployment command, there was no `MODE=refresh`.
====

[NOTE]
====
During the update, the metrics components do not run.
Because of this, they cannot collect data
and a gap normally appears in the graphs.
====

[[additional-instructions-per-release]]
== Additional Manual Steps Per Release

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#admin-guide-manage-scc[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
====
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
xref:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.adoc#using-the-container-network-stack[using
the container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

====
----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
====
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`
endif::[]

[[manual-upgrades-verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                 LABELS                                                                STATUS
master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
----
====

Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:

====
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.2.1.9",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.2.1.9",
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
endif::[]

After upgrading, you can use the diagnostics tool on the master to look for
common issues:

====
----
# oadm diagnostics
...
[Note] Summary of diagnostics execution:
[Note] Completed with no errors or warnings seen.
----
====

[[manual-upgrades-advanced-topics]]
== Advanced Topics

Blue-green deployments are a proven approach to reducing downtime caused while
updating an environment. This is done by creating a parallel environment on
which the new deployment can be installed. If a problem is detected and after
the new deployment is verified, traffic can be switched over with the option to
rollback.

While blue-green is a valid strategy for deploying just about any software,
there are always trade-offs to be made. Not all environments have the same
uptime requirements or the resources to properly perform blue-green deployments.
In an {product-title} environment the most suitable candidate for blue-green
deployments are the Nodes. Uptime is most important for these workloads and the
additional complexity of blue-green deployments can be justified. Often the main
challenge is having the excess capacity to facilitate such an approach.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Another lesser challenge is that the administrator will have to temporarily
share the entitlements between the blue-green deployments or provide access to
the installation content by means of a system such as Red Hat Satellite. This
can be accomplished by sharing the consumer ID from the previous host.

On the old host:
----
# subscription-manager identity | grep system
system identity: 6699375b-06db-48c4-941e-689efd6ce3aa
----

=== Preparing for Upgrade

xref:#upgrading-masters[After the master and etcd servers have been upgraded],
you need to ensure that your current production nodes are labeled either blue or
green. In this example, the current installation will be blue and the new
environment will be green.

----
$ oc label --all nodes color=blue
----

In the case of nodes requiring the uptime guarantees of a blue-green deployment,
the `-l` flag can be used to match a subset of the environment using a selector.

Next, xref:../install/advanced_install.adoc#adding-nodes-advanced[the green
environment] should be created for any nodes that are to be replaced. Ansible
can apply the `*color=green*` using the `*openshift_node_labels*` variable for
each node.

In order to delay workload scheduling until the nodes are
xref:../dev_guide/application_health.adoc#dev-guide-application-health[healthy],
be sure to set the `*openshift_schedulable=false*` variable.

Once the green nodes are in *Ready* state, they can be made schedulable. Then,
blue nodes are disabled so that no new pods are run on them.

----
# oadm manage-node --schedulable=true --selector=color=green
# oadm manage-node --schedulable=false --selector=color=blue
----

A common practice is to scale the registry and router pods until they are
migrated to the green nodes. For these pods, a _canary_ deployment approach is
commonly used. Scaling them up will make them immediately active on the new
nodes. Pointing the deployment configuration to the new image initiates a
rolling update. However, because of node anti-affinity, and the fact that the
blue nodes are still unschedulable, the deployments to the old nodes will fail.
At this point, the registry and router deployments can be scaled down to the
original number of pods. At any given point, the original number of pods is
still available so no capacity is lost.

[[manual-upgrades-warming-the-new-nodes]]
=== Warming the New Nodes

In order for pods to be migrated from the blue environment to the green, the
images must be pulled. Network latency and load on the registry can cause delays
if there is not sufficient capacity built in to the environment. Often, the best
way to minimize impact to the running system is to trigger new pod deployments that
will land on the new nodes. Accomplish this by importing new *ImageStreams*.

A major release of {product-title} is the motivation for a
blue-green deployment. At that time, new *ImageStreams* become
available for users of Source-to-Image. Upon import, any builds or deployments
configured with *ImageChangeTriggers* are automatically created.

It is important to realize that this process can trigger a large number of
builds. The good news is that the builds are performed on the green nodes and,
therefore, do not impact any traffic on the blue deployment.

Monitor build progress:

----
$ oc get events -w --all-namespaces
----

In large environments, builds rarely completely stop. However, you should see a
large increase and decrease caused by the administrative import.

Another benefit of triggering the builds is that it does a fairly good job of
fetching the majority of the ancillary images to all nodes such as the various
build images, the pod infrastructure image, and deployers. Everything else can
be moved over using node evacuation and will proceed more quickly as a result.

[[manual-upgrades-node-evacuation]]
=== Node Evacuation

For larger deployments, it is possible to have other labels that help
determine how evacuation can be coordinated. The most conservative approach
for avoiding downtime is to evacuate one node at a time. If services are
composed of pods using zone anti-affinity, then an entire zone can be
evacuated at once. It is important to ensure that the storage volumes used are
available in the new zone as this detail can vary among cloud providers.

In OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 and later, a node evacuation is triggered whenever
the service is stopped. Achieve manual evacuation and deletion of all blue nodes
at once by:

----
# oadm manage-node --selector=color=blue --evacuate
# oc delete node --selector=color=blue
----

[[manual-upgrades-summary]]
=== Summary

In the {product-title} environment, the most suitable candidate for blue-green
deployments is the node tier. All user processes run on these systems and even
critical pieces of {product-title} infrastructure are self-hosted there. Uptime
is most important for these workloads and the additional complexity of
blue-green deployments can be justified. The exact implementation of this
approach varies based on your requirements.
