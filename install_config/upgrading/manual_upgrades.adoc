====

As an alternative to performing an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated upgrade],
you can manually upgrade your OpenShift cluster. To manually upgrade without
disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as documented in this
topic.

Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself now with the entire
procedure. xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may
require additional steps] to be performed at key points before or during the
standard upgrade process.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that you have met all
xref:../../install_config/install/prerequisites.adoc#install-config-install-prerequisites[prerequisites]
before proceeding with an upgrade. Failure to do so can result in a failed
upgrade.

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

[NOTE]
====
Before upgrading your cluster to {product-title} 3.6, the cluster must be
already upgraded to the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/release_notes/ocp_3_5_release_notes.html#ocp-35-asynchronous-errata-updates[latest asynchronous release of version 3.5]. Cluster upgrades cannot span more than one
minor version at a time, so if your cluster is at a version earlier than 3.5,
you must first upgrade incrementally (e.g., 3.3 to 3.4, then 3.4 to 3.5).
====

[NOTE]
====
Before attempting the upgrade, follow the steps in
xref:manual-upgrades-verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the Upgrade] to verify the
cluster's health. This will confirm that nodes are in the *Ready* state, running
the expected starting version, and will ensure that there are no diagnostic
errors or warnings.
====

To prepare for a manual upgrade, follow these steps:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

. If you are upgrading from {product-title} 3.5 to 3.6, manually disable the 3.5
channel and enable the 3.6 channel on each host:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.5-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms"
----
+
On RHEL 7 systems, also clear the *yum* cache:
+
----
# yum clean all
----
endif::[]

. Install or update to the latest available version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package on each RHEL 7 system, which provides files
that will be used in later sections:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----

.. When installing or updating *atomic-openshift-utils*,
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/_*  does not get updated with the latest
templates. To update the file:
+
----
# mkdir /usr/share/openshift/examples
# cp -R /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v3.6/* /usr/share/openshift/examples/
----

. Install or update to the following latest available **-excluder* packages on
each RHEL 7 system, which helps ensure your systems stay on the correct versions
of *atomic-openshift* and *docker* packages when you are not trying to upgrade,
according to the {product-title} version:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-excluder atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----
+
These packages add entries to the `exclude` directive in the host's
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file.

. Create an *etcd* backup on each master. The *etcd* package is required, even if
using embedded etcd, for access to the `etcdctl` command to make the backup.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *etcd* package is installed by default for RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems. If
the master is a RHEL 7 system and *etcd* is not already installed, install it
now:

----
# yum install etcd
----
====
+
To create the backup, run:
+
----
# ETCD_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd <1>
# etcdctl backup \
    --data-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR \
    --backup-dir $ETCD_DATA_DIR.bak.<date> <2>
----
<1> This directory is for embedded etcd.
For external etcd, use *_/var/lib/etcd_* instead.
<2> Use the date of the backup, or some unique identifier, for `<date>`.
The command will not make a backup if the `--backup-dir` location
already exists.

. For any upgrade path, ensure that you are running the latest kernel on
each RHEL 7 system:
+
----
# yum update kernel
----

[[upgrading-masters]]
== Upgrading Master Components

Before upgrading any stand-alone nodes, upgrade the master components (which
provide the _control plane_ for the cluster).

. Run the following command on each master to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----

. Upgrade *etcd* on all master hosts and any external etcd hosts.

.. For RHEL 7 systems using the RPM-based method:

... Upgrade the *etcd* package:
+
----
# yum update etcd
----

... Restart the *etcd* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart etcd
# journalctl -r -u etcd
----

.. For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems and RHEL 7 systems using the containerized
method:

... Pull the latest *rhel7/etcd* image:
+
----
# docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/etcd
----

... Restart the *etcd_container* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart etcd_container
# journalctl -r -u etcd_container
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1:

.. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.
Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----

.. Enable the following renamed service(s) on master hosts.
+
For single master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master
----
+
For multi-master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master-api
# systemctl enable origin-master-controllers
----

. Restart the master service(s) on each master and review logs to ensure they
restart successfully.
+
For single master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# journalctl -r -u origin-master
----
+
For multi-master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-controllers
# systemctl restart origin-master-api
# journalctl -r -u origin-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u origin-master-api
----

. Because masters also have node components running on them in order to be
configured as part of the OpenShift SDN, restart the *origin-node* and
*openvswitch* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart origin-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u origin-node
----

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. On each master host, upgrade the *atomic-openshift* packages or related images.

.. For masters using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages and the *openvswitch* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\* openvswitch
----

.. For masters using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter to the version you are upgrading to
in the following files:
+
--
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* (single master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers_* (multi-master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api_* (multi-master clusters only)
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_*
- *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-openvswitch_*
--
+
For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=<tag>
----
+
Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-tag}` for the latest version.

. Restart the master service(s) on each master and review logs to ensure they
restart successfully.
+
For single master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master
----
+
For multi-master clusters:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master-api
----

. Because masters also have node components running on them in order to be
configured as part of the OpenShift SDN, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and
*openvswitch* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

endif::[]
. If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.12, you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker
1.12:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The node component on masters is set by default to unschedulable status during
initial installation, so that pods are not deployed to them. However, it is
possible to set them schedulable during the initial installation or manually
thereafter. If any of your masters are also configured as a schedulable node,
skip the following Docker upgrade steps for those masters and instead run all
steps described in xref:upgrading-nodes[Upgrading Nodes] when you get to that
section for those hosts as well.
====

.. Upgrade the *docker* package.

... For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

... For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
[NOTE]
====
If upgrading to RHEL Atomic Host 7.3.2, this upgrades Docker to version 1.12.
====
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----

.. After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

.. Remove the following file, which is no longer required:
+
----
# rm /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker-sdn-ovs.conf
----

. Run the following command on each master to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

[NOTE]
====
During the cluster upgrade, it can sometimes be useful to take a master out of
rotation since some DNS client libraries will not properly to the other masters
for cluster DNS. In addition to stopping the master and controller services, you
can remove the EndPoint from the Kubernetes service's `*subsets.addresses*`.

----
$ oc edit ep/kubernetes -n default
----

When the master is restarted, the Kubernetes service will be automatically
updated.
====

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

After a cluster upgrade, the default roles
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] are automatically updated. To check if all defaults are set as
recommended for your environment, run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

[WARNING]
====
If you have customized default cluster roles and want to ensure a role reconciliation
does not modify those customized roles, annotate them with `openshift.io/reconcile-protect`
set to `true` when using the old Openshift policy format. When using the new RBAC
roles, use `rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate` set to `false` instead.
In doing so, you are responsible for manually updating those roles with any new
or required permissions during upgrades.
====

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy using the following process:

. Reconcile the cluster roles:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

. Reconcile the cluster role bindings:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-role-bindings \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated \
    --exclude-groups=system:authenticated:oauth \
    --exclude-groups=system:unauthenticated \
    --exclude-users=system:anonymous \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----
+
Also run:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-role-bindings \
    system:build-strategy-jenkinspipeline \
    --confirm \
    -o name
----

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can alternatively use the
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#upgrading-blue-green-deployments[blue-green
deployment] method at this point to create a parallel environment for new nodes
instead of upgrading them in place.
====

One at at time for each node that is not also a master, you must disable
scheduling and evacuate its pods to other nodes, then upgrade packages and
restart services.

. Run the following command on each node to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----

. As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, disable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----

. Evacuate pods on the node to other nodes:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--force` option deletes any pods that are not backed by a replication
controller.
====
+
----
# oadm drain <node> --force --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On the node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on the node host:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

. Restart the *origin-node* and *openvswitch* services and review the logs to
ensure they restart successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart origin-node
# journalctl -r -u origin-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
----

endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Upgrade the node component packages or related images.

.. For nodes using the RPM-based method on a RHEL 7 system, upgrade all installed
*atomic-openshift* packages and the *openvswitch* package:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\* openvswitch
----

.. For nodes using the containerized method on a RHEL 7 or RHEL Atomic Host 7
system, set the `*IMAGE_VERSION*` parameter in the
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openvswitch_*
files to the version you are upgrading to. For example:
+
----
IMAGE_VERSION=<tag>
----
+
Replace `<tag>` with `{latest-tag}` for the latest version.

. Restart the *atomic-openshift-node* and *openvswitch* services and review the
logs to ensure they restart successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart openvswitch
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u openvswitch
----
endif::[]

. If you are performing a cluster upgrade that requires updating Docker to version
1.12, you must also perform the following steps if you are not already on Docker
1.12:

.. Upgrade the *docker* package.

... For RHEL 7 systems:
+
----
# yum update docker
----
+
Then, restart the *docker* service and review the logs to ensure it restarts
successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart docker
# journalctl -r -u docker
----
+
After Docker is restarted, restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service again and
review the logs to ensure it restarts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-node
----

... For RHEL Atomic Host 7 systems, upgrade to the latest Atomic tree if one is
available:
+
[NOTE]
====
If upgrading to RHEL Atomic Host 7.3.2, this upgrades Docker to version 1.12.
====
+
----
# atomic host upgrade
----
+
After the upgrade is completed and prepared for the next boot, reboot the host
and ensure the *docker* service starts successfully:
+
----
# systemctl reboot
# journalctl -r -u docker
----

.. Remove the following file, which is no longer required:
+
----
# rm /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/docker-sdn-ovs.conf
----

. Re-enable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable
----

. Run the following command on each node to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

. Repeat the previous steps on the next node, and continue repeating these steps
until all nodes have been upgraded.

. After all nodes have been upgraded, as a user with *cluster-admin* privileges,
verify that all nodes are showing as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                        STATUS                     AGE
master.example.com          Ready,SchedulingDisabled   165d

----

[[upgrading-the-router]]
== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-service[highly-available
routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

----
# oc edit dc/router
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:<tag> <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
<1> Adjust `<tag>` to match the version you are upgrading to (use `{latest-tag}`
for the latest version).

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry.
xref:../../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#storage-for-the-registry[Storage for the Registry] details how to configure persistent storage for the registry.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:<tag> <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
<1> Adjust `<tag>` to match the version you are upgrading to (use `{latest-tag}`
for the latest version).

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If the registry console is deployed, edit its deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/registry-console
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:

        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/registry-console:v3.6
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[updating-the-registry-configuration-file]]
=== Updating Custom Registry Configuration Files

[NOTE]
====
You may safely skip this part if you do not use a custom registry configuration
file.
====

The internal Docker registry version 1.4.0 and higher requires following entries
in the
xref:../registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[middleware section] of the configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
middleware:
  registry:
    - name: openshift
  repository:
    - name: openshift
  storage:
    - name: openshift
----

. Edit your custom configuration file, adding the missing entries.

. xref:../registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[Deploy
your updated configuration].

. Append the `--overwrite` flag to `oc volume
dc/docker-registry --add` to replace a volume mount of your previous secret.

. You can safely remove the old secret.

[[enforcing-quota-in-the-registry]]
=== Enforcing Quota in the Registry

Quota must be enforced to prevent layer blobs that exceed the size limit from
being written to the registry's storage. This can be achieved via a
xref:../registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#registry-configuration-reference[configuration file]:

----
...
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        enforcequota: true
...
----

Alternatively, use the `*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA*`
environment variable, which is set to `*true*` for the new registry deployments
by default. Existing deployments need to be modified using:

----
# oc set env dc/docker-registry REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA=true
----
endif::[]

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp
templates, and database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a
default project to which all users have view access. These objects were created
during installation from the JSON files located under
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*.

To update these objects:

. Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out, which
provides the example JSON files:
+
----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods automatically create default image streams, InstantApp templates, and
database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a default
project to which all users have view access. These objects were created during
installation from the JSON files located under the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/_*
directory.

[NOTE]
====
Because RHEL Atomic Host 7 cannot use *yum* to update packages, the following
steps must take place on a RHEL 7 system.
====

Update the packages that provide the example JSON files. On a subscribed Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system where you can run the CLI as a user with
*cluster-admin* permissions, install or update to the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-* packages:

----

[id='{sect}-updating-master-and-node-certificates']
== Updating Master and Node Certificates

The following steps may be required for any OpenShift cluster that was
originally installed prior to the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.8 release].
This may include any and all updates from that version.

[id='{sect}-updating-node-certificates']
=== Node Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated
to include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before
the 1.0.8 release may not contain the IP address of the node.

If a node is missing the IP address as part of its certificate, clients may
refuse to connect to the kubelet endpoint. Usually this will result in errors
regarding the certificate not containing an `IP SAN`.

In order to remedy this situation, you may need to manually update the
certificates for your node.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-nodes-certificate']
==== Checking the Node's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the node's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mynode*, *mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*:

====
----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/node/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mynode, DNS:mynode.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----
====

Ensure that the `*nodeIP*` value set in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file is present in the IP values from the
Subject Alternative Names listed in the node's serving certificate. If the
`*nodeIP*` is not present, then it will need to be added to the node's
certificate.

If the `*nodeIP*` value is already contained within the Subject Alternative
Names, then no further steps are required.

You will need to know the Subject Alternative Names and `*nodeIP*` value for the
following steps.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-node-certificate']
==== Generating a New Node Certificate

If your current node certificate does not contain the proper IP address, then
you must regenerate a new certificate for your node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Node certificates will be regenerated on the master (or first master) and are
then copied into place on node systems.
====

. Create a temporary directory in which to perform the following steps:
+
----
# mkdir /tmp/node_certificate_update
# cd /tmp/node_certificate_update
----

. Export the signing options:
+
----
# export signing_opts="--signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt"
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=<existing_SANs>,<nodeIP>
----
+
For example, if the Subject Alternative Names from before were *mynode*,
*mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*, and the `*nodeIP*` was 10.10.10.1, then
you would need to run the following command:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=mynode,mynode.mydomain.com,1.2.3.4,10.10.10.1
----

[id='{sect}-replace-node-serving-certificates']
==== Replace Node Serving Certificates

Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/node/server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/node/server.key_* files for your node:

----
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key.bak
----

You must now copy the new *_server.crt_* and *_server.key_* created in the
temporary directory during the previous step:

----
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key
----

After you have replaced the node's certificate, restart the node service:

----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----

[id='{sect}-updating-master-certificates']
=== Master Certificates

With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 1.0.8 release may not contain these additional
service names.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-masters-certificate']
==== Checking the Master's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the master's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mymaster*, *mymaster.mydomain.com*, and
*1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mymaster, DNS:mymaster.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the following entries are present in the Subject Alternative Names
for the master's serving certificate:

[options="header"]
|===
|Entry |Example

|Kubernetes service IP address
|172.30.0.1

|All master host names
|*master1.example.com*

|All master IP addresses
|192.168.122.1

|Public master host name in clustered environments
|*public-master.example.com*

|*kubernetes*
|

|*kubernetes.default*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*
|

|*openshift*
|

|*openshift.default*
|

|*openshift.default.svc*
|

|*openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*
|
|===

If these names are already contained within the Subject Alternative Names, then
no further steps are required.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-master-certificate']
==== Generating a New Master Certificate

If your current master certificate does not contain all names from the list
above, then you must generate a new certificate for your master:

. Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/master/master.server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/master/master.server.key_* files for your master:
+
----
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.key /etc/origin/master/master.server.key.bak
----

. Export the service names. These names will be used when generating the new
certificate:
+
----
# export service_names="kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,openshift,openshift.default,openshift.default.svc,openshift.default.svc.cluster.local"
----

. You will need the first IP in the services
subnet (the *kubernetes* service IP) as well as the values of `*masterIP*`,
`*masterURL*` and `*publicMasterURL*` contained in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file for the following steps.
+
The *kubernetes* service IP can be obtained with:
+
----
# oc get svc/kubernetes --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
====
----
# oadm ca create-master-certs \
      --hostnames=<master_hostnames>,<master_IP_addresses>,<kubernetes_service_IP>,$service_names \ <1> <2> <3>
      --master=<internal_master_address> \ <4>
      --public-master=<public_master_address> \ <5>
      --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
      --overwrite=false
----
<1> Adjust `<master_hostnames>` to match your master host name. In a clustered
environment, add all master host names.
<2> Adjust `<master_IP_addresses>` to match the value of `*masterIP*`. In a
clustered environment, add all master IP addresses.
<3> Adjust `<kubernetes_service_IP>` to the first IP in the *kubernetes*
services subnet.
<4> Adjust `<internal_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterURL*`.
<5> Adjust `<public_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterPublicURL*`.
====

. Restart master services. For single master deployments:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
----
+
For native HA multiple master deployments:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-master-api
# systemctl restart origin-master-controllers
----
+
After the service restarts, the certificate update is complete.

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#admin-guide-manage-scc[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/router
----

Apply the following changes:

----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-the-container-network-stack[using
the container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

====
----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
====
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`

[[openshift-origin-1-1-0]]

[[openshift-origin-1-5-0]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.5.0

With deprecation of the `extensions/v1beta1.Job` resource, you must migrate all
`Job` resources to use the `batch/v1.Job` instead. To verify which objects will
be migrated, run:

----
$ oadm migrate storage --include=jobs
