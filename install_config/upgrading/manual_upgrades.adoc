== Overview

As an alternative to performing an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated upgrade],
you can manually upgrade your OpenShift cluster. To manually upgrade without
disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as documented in this
topic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself now with the entire
procedure. xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may
require additional steps] to be performed at key points before or during the
standard upgrade process.

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, perform the following
steps:

.. On each master and node host, manually disable the 3.0 channel and enable the
3.1 channel:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, perform the following
steps:
endif::[]

.. Create an *etcd* backup on each master:
+
----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----

.. Remove support for the *v1beta3* API. Update the
*_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master, and remove
*v1beta3* from the `*apiLevels*` and `*kubernetesMasterConfig.apiLevels*`
parameters.

.. During this upgrade, some directories are renamed from *openshift* to
*origin*, so create the following symlinks on each host:
+
----
# ln -s /var/lib/openshift /var/lib/origin
# ln -s /etc/openshift /etc/origin
----

. Install or update to the following latest available **-excluder* packages on
each RHEL 7 system, which helps ensure your systems stay on the correct versions
of *atomic-openshift* and *docker* packages when you are not trying to upgrade,
according to the {product-title} version:
+
----
# yum install atomic-openshift-excluder atomic-openshift-docker-excluder
----
+
These packages add entries to the `exclude` directive in the host's
*_/etc/yum.conf_* file.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. If you are already running OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 or later, create an *etcd*
backup by running:
+
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 or later, create an *etcd* backup
by running:
+
endif::[]
----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----

. For any upgrade path, always ensure that you are running the latest kernel:
+
----
# yum update kernel
----

[[upgrading-masters]]
== Upgrading Masters
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master*
package:

----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1:

. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
====
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
====
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----
====

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-master* service and review its
logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# journalctl -r -u origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Upgrade your master hosts first:

. Run the following command on each master to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----

. Upgrade the *atomic-openshift* packages or related images.
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift-master
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1:

.. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

.. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----

.. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-master
----

. For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-master* service and
review its logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master
----

. Run the following command on each master to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----
endif::[]

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
== Updating Policy Definitions

After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[default
cluster roles] may have been updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy using the following process:

. Reconcile the cluster roles:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

. Restart the master service:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]

. Reconcile security context constraints:
+
----
# oadm policy reconcile-sccs \
    --additive-only=true \
    --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

To upgrade nodes:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Run the following command on each node to remove the *atomic-openshift*
packages from the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder unexclude
----
endif::[]

. As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, disable scheduling for the node:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. On each node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

. For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-node* service:
+
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. On each node host, upgrade all *atomic-openshift* packages:
+
----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\*
----

. If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-node
----

. For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]

. Enable scheduling again for any non-master nodes that you disabled:
+
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=true
----

. Run the following command on the node to add the *atomic-openshift* packages
back to the list of yum excludes on the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

. Repeat these steps on the next node, and continue repeating these steps until
all nodes have been upgraded.

. After all nodes have been upgraded, as a user with *cluster-admin* privileges,
verify that all nodes are showing as *Ready*:
+
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS
master.example.com      kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com     Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready
node2.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com      Ready
----

[[upgrading-the-router]]
== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
xref:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.adoc#install-config-install-deploy-router[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
xref:additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.1.11 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry.
xref:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.adoc#storage-for-the-registry[Deploying
a Docker Registry] details how to configure persistent storage for the registry.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.1.11 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method automatically creates default image streams, InstantApp
templates, and database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a
default project to which all users have view access. These objects were created
during installation from the JSON files located under
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*.

To update these objects:

. Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out, which
provides the example JSON files:
+
----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
By default, the xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] and
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
methods automatically create default image streams, InstantApp templates, and
database service templates in the *openshift* project, which is a default
project to which all users have view access. These objects were created during
installation from the JSON files located under the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/_*
directory.

[NOTE]
====
Because RHEL Atomic Host 7 cannot use *yum* to update packages, the following
steps must take place on a RHEL 7 system.
====

. Update the packages that provide the example JSON files. On a subscribed Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system where you can run the CLI as a user with
*cluster-admin* permissions, install or update to the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-* packages:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----
+
The *openshift-ansible-roles* package provides the latest example JSON files.
endif::[]

. Update the global *openshift* project by running the following commands.
Receiving warnings about items that already exist is expected.
+

. After a manual upgrade, get the latest templates from
*openshift-ansible-roles*:
+
====
----
rpm -ql openshift-ansible-roles | grep examples | grep v1.2
----
====
+
In this example,
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.2/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json_*
is the latest file that you want in the latest *openshift-ansible-roles* package.
+
*_/usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json_* is not
owned by a package, but is updated by Ansible. If you are upgrading outside of
Ansible. you need to get the latest .json files on the system where you are
running `oc`, which can run anywhere that has access to the master.

. Install *atomic-openshift-utils* and its dependencies to install the new content
into
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/v1.2/_*.:

This may include any and all updates from that version.
endif::[]

[id='{sect}-updating-node-certificates']
=== Node Certificates

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
With the 3.1 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated to
include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before the
3.1 release may not contain the IP address of the node.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the kubelet nodes were updated
to include the IP address of the node. Any node certificates generated before
the 1.0.8 release may not contain the IP address of the node.
endif::[]

If a node is missing the IP address as part of its certificate, clients may
refuse to connect to the kubelet endpoint. Usually this will result in errors
regarding the certificate not containing an `IP SAN`.

In order to remedy this situation, you may need to manually update the
certificates for your node.

[id='{sect}-checking-the-nodes-certificate']
==== Checking the Node's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the node's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mynode*, *mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*:

====
----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/node/server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mynode, DNS:mynode.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----
====

Ensure that the `*nodeIP*` value set in the
*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* file is present in the IP values from the
Subject Alternative Names listed in the node's serving certificate. If the
`*nodeIP*` is not present, then it will need to be added to the node's
certificate.

If the `*nodeIP*` value is already contained within the Subject Alternative
Names, then no further steps are required.

You will need to know the Subject Alternative Names and `*nodeIP*` value for the
following steps.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-node-certificate']
==== Generating a New Node Certificate

If your current node certificate does not contain the proper IP address, then
you must regenerate a new certificate for your node.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Node certificates will be regenerated on the master (or first master) and are
then copied into place on node systems.
====

. Create a temporary directory in which to perform the following steps:
+
----
# mkdir /tmp/node_certificate_update
# cd /tmp/node_certificate_update
----

. Export the signing options:
+
----
# export signing_opts="--signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt"
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=<existing_SANs>,<nodeIP>
----
+
For example, if the Subject Alternative Names from before were *mynode*,
*mynode.mydomain.com*, and *1.2.3.4*, and the `*nodeIP*` was 10.10.10.1, then
you would need to run the following command:
+
----
# oadm ca create-server-cert --cert=server.crt \
  --key=server.key $signing_opts \
  --hostnames=mynode,mynode.mydomain.com,1.2.3.4,10.10.10.1
----

[id='{sect}-replace-node-serving-certificates']
==== Replace Node Serving Certificates

Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/node/server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/node/server.key_* files for your node:

----
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/node/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key.bak
----

You must now copy the new *_server.crt_* and *_server.key_* created in the
temporary directory during the previous step:

----
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.crt /etc/origin/node/server.crt
# mv /tmp/node_certificate_update/server.key /etc/origin/node/server.key
----

After you have replaced the node's certificate, restart the node service:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

[id='{sect}-updating-master-certificates']
=== Master Certificates

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
With the 3.1 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 3.1 release may not contain these additional
service names.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With the 1.0.8 release, certificates for each of the masters were updated to
include all names that pods may use to communicate with masters. Any master
certificates generated before the 1.0.8 release may not contain these additional
service names.
endif::[]

[id='{sect}-checking-the-masters-certificate']
==== Checking the Master's Certificate

The following command can be used to determine which Subject Alternative Names
(SANs) are present in the master's serving certificate. In this example, the
Subject Alternative Names are *mymaster*, *mymaster.mydomain.com*, and
*1.2.3.4*:

----
# openssl x509 -in /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt -text -noout | grep -A 1 "Subject Alternative Name"
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
DNS:mymaster, DNS:mymaster.mydomain.com, IP: 1.2.3.4
----

Ensure that the following entries are present in the Subject Alternative Names
for the master's serving certificate:

[options="header"]
|===
|Entry |Example

|Kubernetes service IP address
|172.30.0.1

|All master host names
|*master1.example.com*

|All master IP addresses
|192.168.122.1

|Public master host name in clustered environments
|*public-master.example.com*

|*kubernetes*
|

|*kubernetes.default*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc*
|

|*kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local*
|

|*openshift*
|

|*openshift.default*
|

|*openshift.default.svc*
|

|*openshift.default.svc.cluster.local*
|
|===

If these names are already contained within the Subject Alternative Names, then
no further steps are required.

[id='{sect}-generating-a-new-master-certificate']
==== Generating a New Master Certificate

If your current master certificate does not contain all names from the list
above, then you must generate a new certificate for your master:

. Back up the existing *_/etc/origin/master/master.server.crt_* and
*_/etc/origin/master/master.server.key_* files for your master:
+
----
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt /etc/origin/master/master.server.crt.bak
# mv /etc/origin/master/master.server.key /etc/origin/master/master.server.key.bak
----

. Export the service names. These names will be used when generating the new
certificate:
+
----
# export service_names="kubernetes,kubernetes.default,kubernetes.default.svc,kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local,openshift,openshift.default,openshift.default.svc,openshift.default.svc.cluster.local"
----

. You will need the first IP in the services
subnet (the *kubernetes* service IP) as well as the values of `*masterIP*`,
`*masterURL*` and `*publicMasterURL*` contained in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file for the following steps.
+
The *kubernetes* service IP can be obtained with:
+
----
# oc get svc/kubernetes --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

. Generate the new certificate:
+
====
----
# oadm ca create-master-certs \
      --hostnames=<master_hostnames>,<master_IP_addresses>,<kubernetes_service_IP>,$service_names \ <1> <2> <3>
      --master=<internal_master_address> \ <4>
      --public-master=<public_master_address> \ <5>
      --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
      --overwrite=false
----
<1> Adjust `<master_hostnames>` to match your master host name. In a clustered
environment, add all master host names.
<2> Adjust `<master_IP_addresses>` to match the value of `*masterIP*`. In a
clustered environment, add all master IP addresses.
<3> Adjust `<kubernetes_service_IP>` to the first IP in the *kubernetes*
services subnet.
<4> Adjust `<internal_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterURL*`.
<5> Adjust `<public_master_address>` to match the value of `*masterPublicURL*`.
====

. Restart master services. For single master deployments:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-master

[[manual-upgrading-efk-logging-stack]]
== Upgrading the EFK Logging Stack

If you have previously xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging[deployed
the EFK logging stack] and want to upgrade to the latest logging component
images, you must take the following steps to safely upgrade with minimal
disruption to your log data.

[NOTE]
====
The following steps apply when you want to update to newer {product-title}
{product-version} logging images, but are not yet fully upgrading your cluster
to a later minor or major release of {product-title}. The `*IMAGE_VERSION*`
variable is used in a later step to ensure that you do not accidentally pull the
wrong images.
====

. Ensure you are working in the project where the EFK stack was previously
deployed, and stay in that project for the remainder of these steps. For
example, if the project is named *logging*:
+
----
$ oc project logging
----

. Scale down your Fluentd instances to 0:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-fluentd --replicas=0
----
+
Wait until they have properly terminated. This helps prevent loss of data by
giving them time to properly flush their current buffer and send any logs they
were processing to Elasticsearch.

. Scale down your Kibana instances:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana --replicas=0
----
+
If you have an operations deployment, also run:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-kibana-ops --replicas=0
----

. Once your Fluentd and Kibana pods are confirmed to be terminated, you can
safely scale down the Elasticsearch pods:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-<unique_name> --replicas=0
----
+
If you have an operations deployment, also run:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-ops-<unique_name> --replicas=0
----

. After your Elasticsearch pods are confirmed to be terminated, pull in the
latest EFK images using the same procedure described in
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#importing-the-latest-images[Importing
the Latest Images], replacing the *openshift* project with the project where the
EFK stack was previously deployed.
+
For example, if the project is named *logging*:
+
----
$ oc import-image -n logging <imagestream>
----
+
The list of image streams are:
+
----
logging-auth-proxy
logging-elasticsearch
logging-fluentd
logging-kibana
----

. With the latest images in your repository, you can now rerun the deployer to
generate any missing or changed features.

.. First, ensure that your OAuth client has been deleted:
+
----
$ oc delete oauthclient --selector logging-infra=support
----

.. Then, proceed to follow the same steps as done previously in
xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Deploying
the EFK Stack], but ensure that you add `*IMAGE_VERSION*` to the list of
variables and set it to the appropriate version. For example, for the latest
3.1.1 image:
+
----
$ oc process logging-deployer-template -n openshift \
           -v IMAGE_VERSION=3.1.1,KIBANA_HOSTNAME=kibana.example.com,ES_CLUSTER_SIZE=1,PUBLIC_MASTER_URL=https://localhost:8443 \
           | oc create -f -
----
+
See
xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging.adoc#deploying-the-efk-stack[Deploying
the EFK Stack] for the full instructions. After the deployer completes,
re-attach your persistent volumes you were using previously.

. Next, scale Elasticsearch back up incrementally so that the cluster has time
to rebuild.

.. To begin, scale up to 1:
+
----
$ oc scale dc/logging-es-<unique_name> --replicas=1
----
+
Follow the logs of the resulting pod to ensure that it is able to recover its
indices correctly and that there are no errors:
+
----
$ oc logs -f <pod_name>
----
+
If that is successful, you can then do the same for the operations cluster, if
one was previously used.

.. After all Elasticsearch nodes have recovered their indices, continue to scale it
back up to the size it was prior to doing maintenance. Check the logs of the
Elasticsearch members to verify that they have correctly joined the cluster and
recovered.

. Now scale Kibana and Fluentd back up to their previous state. Because Fluentd
was shut down and allowed to push its remaining records to Elasticsearch in the
previous steps, it can now pick back up from where it left off with no loss of
logs, provided any unread log files are still available on the node.

. In the latest version, Kibana will display indices differently now in order
to prevent users from being able to access the logs of previously created
projects that have been deleted.
+
Due to this change, your old logs will not appear automatically. To migrate your
old indices to the new format, rerun the deployer with `-v MODE=migrate` in addition
to your prior flags. This should be run while your Elasticsearch cluster is running, as the
script must connect to it to make changes.
+
[NOTE]
====
This only impacts non-operations logs. Operations logs will appear the same as
in previous versions. There should be minimal performance impact to
Elasticsearch while running this and it will not perform an install.
====

[[additional-instructions-per-release]]
== Additional Manual Steps Per Release

Some OpenShift releases may have additional instructions specific to that
release that must be performed to fully apply the updates across the cluster.
Read through the following sections carefully depending on your upgrade path, as
you may be required to perform certain steps at key points during the standard
upgrade process described earlier in this topic.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
See the xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ose-3-1-release-notes[OpenShift Enterprise
3.1 Release Notes] to review the latest release notes.

[[manual-step-ose-3-1-0]]
=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0

There are no additional manual steps for these releases that are not already
mentioned inline during the xref:preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade[standard manual upgrade
process].

[[manual-step-ose-3-1-1]]
=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1

There was an issue with OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.1 where hosts with host names
that resolved to IP addresses that were not local to the host would run into
problems with liveness and readiness probes on newly-created HAProxy routers.
This was resolved in
https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.1/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2016:0293[RHBA-2016:0293]
by configuring the probes to use *localhost* as the hostname for pods with
`*hostPort*` values.

If you created a router under the affected version, and your liveness or
readiness probes unexpectedly fail for your router, then add *host: localhost*:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            host: localhost <1>
            path: /healthz
            port: 1936
            scheme: HTTP
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          timeoutSeconds: 1
        ...
        readinessProbe:

            path: /healthz
            port: 1936
            scheme: HTTP
          timeoutSeconds: 1
----
<1> Add 'host: localhost' to your liveness probe.
<2> Add 'host: localhost' to your readiness probe.
====

[[manual-step-ose-3-1-1-11]]
=== {product-title} 3.1.1.11

There are no additional manual steps for the upgrade to
xref:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.adoc#ose-3-1-1-11[{product-title}
3.1.1.11] that are not already mentioned inline during the standard manual
upgrade process.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[openshift-origin-1-1-0]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.1.0

There are no additional manual steps for this release that are not already
mentioned inline during the xref:preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade[standard manual upgrade
process].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#admin-guide-manage-scc[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
====
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
xref:../../install_config/install/deploy_router.adoc#using-the-container-network-stack[using
the container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the xref:upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

====
----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
====
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`
endif::[]

[[manual-upgrades-verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                 LABELS                                                                STATUS
master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
----
====

Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:

====
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.1.11",

# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you upgraded from OSE 3.0 to OSE 3.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* and
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* files.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
endif::[]

After upgrading, you can use the experimental diagnostics tool to look for
common issues:
