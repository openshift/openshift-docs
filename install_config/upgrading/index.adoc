When new versions of OpenShift are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.0 to
3.1, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.1.z
releases). See the link:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.html[OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the core architectural changes between the major versions, OpenShift
Enterprise 2 environments cannot be upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3 and
require a fresh installation.
====
endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.
