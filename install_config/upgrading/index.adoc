When new versions of {product-title} are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.6 to
3.7, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.7.z
releases). See the xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_7_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ocp-3-7-release-notes[{product-title} 3.7 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the xref:../../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.adoc#release-notes-v2-vs-v3[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to {product-title} 3 and require a fresh installation.

endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade[across
one minor version], so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

== In-place or Blue-Green Upgrades

There are two methods for performing {product-title} cluster upgrades. You can
either do in-place upgrades (automated or manual), or upgrade using a
blue-green deployment method.

==== In-place Upgrades

With in-place upgrades, the cluster upgrade is performed on all hosts in a
single, running cluster: first masters and then nodes. Pods are evacuated off of
nodes and recreated on other running nodes before a node upgrade begins; this
helps reduce downtime of user applications.

If you installed using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] or
endif::[]
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was
used is available, you can perform an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated in-place upgrade].
Alternatively, you can
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[upgrade in-place manually].

==== Blue-green Deployments

The
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#upgrading-blue-green-deployments[blue-green deployment] upgrade method follows a similar flow to the in-place method:
masters and etcd servers are still upgraded first, however a parallel
environment is created for new nodes instead of upgrading them in-place.

This method allows administrators to switch traffic from the old set of nodes
(e.g., the "blue" deployment) to the new set (e.g., the "green" deployment)
after the new deployment has been verified. If a problem is detected, it is also
then easy to rollback to the old deployment quickly.
