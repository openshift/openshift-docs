When new versions of {product-title} are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.2 to
3.3, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.3.z
releases). See the xref:../../release_notes/index.adoc#release-notes-index[{product-title} 3.3 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the xref:../../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.adoc#release-notes-v2-vs-v3[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to {product-title} 3 and require a fresh installation.
====
endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

== In-place or Blue-Green Upgrades

There are two methods for performing {product-title} cluster upgrades. You can
either do in-place upgrades (automated or manual), or upgrade using a
blue-green deployment method.

**In-place Upgrades**

With in-place upgrades, the cluster upgrade is performed on all hosts in a
single cluster. If you installed using the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick] or
endif::[]
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation]
and the *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was
used is available, you can perform an
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated in-place upgrade].
Alternatively, you can
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[upgrade in-place manually].

**Blue-green Deployments**

With
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/blue_green_deployments.adoc#upgrading-blue-green-deployments[blue-green deployments], you can reduce downtime caused while upgrading an environment by
creating a parallel environment on which the new deployment can be installed. If
a problem is detected, and after the new deployment is verified, traffic can be
switched over with the option to rollback.
