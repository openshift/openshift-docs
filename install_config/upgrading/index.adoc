When new versions of {product-title} are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub to review
the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.2 to
3.3, and applying asynchronous errata updates within a minor version (3.3.z
releases). See the
xref:../../release_notes/ocp_3_3_release_notes.adoc#release-notes-ocp-3-3-release-notes[{product-title}
3.3 Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the xref:../../release_notes/v2_vs_v3.adoc#release-notes-v2-vs-v3[core architectural changes]
between the major versions, OpenShift Enterprise 2 environments cannot be
upgraded to {product-title} 3 and require a fresh installation.

endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.
