== Updating and Upgrading the Operating System

Updating or upgrading your operating system (OS), by either changing OS versions
or updating the system software, can impact the {product-title} software running
on those machines. In particular, these updates can affect the `iptables` rules
or `ovs` flows that {product-title} requires to operate.

Use the following to safely upgrade the OS on a host:

. Ensure the host is unschedulable, meaning that no new pods will be placed onto the host:
+
----
$ oc adm manage-node <node_name> --schedulable=false
----

. Migrate the pods from the host:
+
----
$ oc adm drain <node_name> --force --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets
----

. In order to protect sensitive packages that do not need to be updated,
apply the exclude rules to the host:
+
----
# atomic-openshift-docker-excluder exclude
# atomic-openshift-excluder exclude
----

. Update the host packages and reboot the host. A reboot ensures that the host is
running the newest versions and means that the `docker` and {product-title}
processes have been restarted, which forces them to check that all of the
rules in other services are correct.
+
----
 # yum update
 # reboot
----
+
However, instead of rebooting a node host, you can restart the services that are
affected or preserve the `iptables` state. Both processes are described in the
xref:../../admin_guide/iptables.adoc#admin-guide-iptables[{product-title}
IPtables] topic. The `ovs` flow rules do not need to be saved, but restarting
the {product-title} node software fixes the flow rules.

. Configure the host to be schedulable again:
+
----
$ oc adm manage-node <node_name> --schedulable=true
----
