== Overview

If you are using the Pacemaker method for high availability (HA) masters, you
can upgrade to the native HA method either using Ansible playbooks or
manually. Both methods are described in the following sections.

[[pm-native-playbooks]]
== Using Ansible Playbooks

These steps assume that cluster has been upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
using either the
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[manual] or
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated] method.

[WARNING]
====
Playbooks used for the Pacemaker to native HA upgrade will re-run cluster
configuration steps, therefore any settings that are not stored in your
inventory file will be overwritten. Back up any configuration files that have
been modified since installation before beginning this upgrade.
====

[[pm-native-playbooks-modifying-the-ansible-inventory]]
=== Modifying the Ansible Inventory

Your original Ansible inventory file's Pacemaker configuration contains a VIP
and a cluster host name which should resolve to this VIP. Native HA requires a
cluster host name which resolves to the load balancer being used.

Consider the following example configuration:

====
----
# Pacemaker high availability cluster method.
# Pacemaker HA environment must be able to self provision the
# configured VIP. For installation openshift_master_cluster_hostname
# must resolve to the configured VIP.
#openshift_master_cluster_method=pacemaker
#openshift_master_cluster_password=openshift_cluster
#openshift_master_cluster_vip=192.168.133.35
#openshift_master_cluster_public_vip=192.168.133.35
#openshift_master_cluster_hostname=openshift-cluster.example.com
#openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname=openshift-cluster.example.com
----
====

Remove or comment the above section in your inventory file. Then, add the
following section, modifying the host names to match your current cluster host
names:

====
----
# Native high availability cluster method with optional load balancer.
# If no lb group is defined, the installer assumes that a load balancer has
# been preconfigured. For installation the value of
# openshift_master_cluster_hostname must resolve to the load balancer
# or to one or all of the masters defined in the inventory if no load
# balancer is present.
openshift_master_cluster_method=native
openshift_master_cluster_hostname=openshift-cluster.example.com
openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname=openshift-cluster.example.com
----
====

Native HA requires a load balancer to balance the master API (port 8443). When
modifying your inventory file, specify an `[lb]` group and add `lb` to the
`[OSEv3:children]` section if you would like the playbooks to configure an
HAProxy instance as the load balancer. This instance must be on a separate host
from the masters and nodes:

====
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
lb
...
[lb]
lb1.example.com <1>
----
<1> Host name of the HAProxy load balancer.
====

Any external load balancer may be used in place of the default HAProxy host, but
it must be pre-configured and allow API traffic to masters on port 8443.

[[pm-native-playbooks-destroying-the-pacemaker-cluster]]
==== Destroying the Pacemaker Cluster

On any master, run the following to destroy the Pacemaker cluster.

[WARNING]
====
After the Pacemaker cluster has been destroyed, the OpenShift cluster will be in
outage until the remaining steps are completed.
====

----
# pcs cluster destroy --all
----

[[pm-native-playbooks-updating-dns]]
=== Updating DNS

Modify your cluster host name DNS entries such that the host name used resolves
to the load balancer that will be used with native HA.

In the xref:pm-native-playbooks-modifying-the-ansible-inventory[earlier example
configuration], *openshift-cluster.example.com* resolves to 192.168.133.35. DNS
must be modified such that *openshift-cluster.example.com* now resolves to the
load balancer host or to the master API balancer in an alternative load
balancing solution.

[[pm-native-playbooks-running-the-ansible-playbook]]
=== Running the Ansible Playbook

You can now run the following Ansible playbook:

[WARNING]
====
Back up any configuration files that have been modified since installation before
beginning this upgrade.
====

----
# ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

After the playbook finishes successfully, your upgrade to the native HA method
is complete. Restore any configuration files if you backed up any that had been
modified since installation, and restart any relevant OpenShift services, if
necessary.

[[pm-native-manual]]
== Manually Upgrading

These steps assume that cluster has been upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
using either the
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-manual-upgrades[manual] or
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/automated_upgrades.adoc#install-config-upgrading-automated-upgrades[automated] method.
They also assume that you are bringing your own load balancer which has been
configured to balance the master API on port 8443.

[[pm-native-manual-creating-unit-and-system-configuration-for-new-services]]
=== Creating Unit and System Configuration for New Services

The Systemd unit files for the *atomic-openshift-master-api* and
*atomic-openshift-master-controllers* services are not yet provided by
packaging. Ansible creates unit and system configuration when installing with
the native HA method.

Therefore, create the following files:

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
*atomic-openshift* can be replaced with *origin* in all steps to target the
**origin* deployment type.
====

=== Destroying the Pacemaker Cluster

On any master, run the following to destroy the Pacemaker cluster.

[WARNING]
====
After the Pacemaker cluster has been destroyed, the OpenShift cluster will be
in outage until the remaining steps are completed.
====

----
# pcs cluster destroy --all
----

[[pm-native-manual-updating-dns]]
=== Updating DNS

Modify your cluster host name DNS entries such that the host name used resolves
to the load balancer that will be used with native HA.

For example, if the cluster host name is *openshift-cluster.example.com* and it
resolved to a VIP of 192.168.133.35, then DNS must be modified such that
*openshift-cluster.example.com* now resolves to the master API balancer.

[[pm-native-manual-modyfing-master-and-node-configuration]]
=== Modifying Master and Node Configuration

Edit the master configuration in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
file and ensure that `*kubernetesMasterConfig.masterCount*` is updated to the
total number of masters. Perform this step on all masters:

.*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* File
====
----
...
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  apiServerArguments:
    controllerArguments:
      masterCount: 3 <1>
...
----
<1> Update this value to the total number of masters.
====

Edit the node configuration in the *_/etc/orign/node/node-config.yaml_* file and
remove the `*dnsIP*` setting. OpenShift will use the Kubernetes service IP as
the `*dnsIP*` by default. Perform this step on all nodes:

.*_/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml_* File
====
----
...
allowDisabledDocker: false
apiVersion: v1
dnsDomain: cluster.local
dnsIP: 10.6.102.3 <1>
dockerConfig:
  execHandlerName: ""
...
----
<1> Remove this line.
====

[[pm-native-manual-starting-the-api-service]]
==== Starting the API Service

Start and enable the API service on all masters:

----
# systemctl start atomic-openshift-master-api
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-master-api
----

[[pm-native-manual-starting-the-controller-service]]
==== Starting the Controller Service

Start and enable the controllers service on all masters:

----
# systemctl start atomic-openshift-master-controllers
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

After the service restarts, your upgrade to the native HA method is complete.

[[pm-native-manual-modifying-the-ansible-inventory]]
=== Modifying the Ansible Inventory

Optionally, modify your Ansible inventory file for future runs per the
instructions above in
xref:pm-native-playbooks-modifying-the-ansible-inventory[the playbooks method].
