== Overview

Until {product-title} 3.6 it was possible to deploy a cluster with an embedded etcd.
Since {product-title} 3.7 it is no longer possible.
Additionaly, the etcd API version since {product-title} 3.6 defaults to v3
and since {product-title} 3.7 the v3 is the only version allowed.
Thus, older deployments with embedded etcd with the etcd API version v2 need to migrate
to the external etcd first
xref:../../install_config/upgrading/migrating_etcd.adoc[followed by data migration]
before they can be upgrade to {product-title} 3.7.

This migration process performs the following steps:

- Stop the master service
- Perform an etcd backup of embedded etcd
- Deploy external etcd (on the master or new host)
- Perform backup of original etcd master certificates
- Generate new etcd certificates for the master
- Transfer embedded etcd backup to the external etcd host
- Start external etcd from the transfered etcd backup
- Re-configure master to use the external etcd
- Start master

[[etcd-embedded-migration-automated]]
== Running the Automated Migration Playbook

Either migration to external rpm etcd or external containerized etcd is currently supported.

A migration playbook is provided to automate all aspects of the process; this is the preferred method for performing the migration.
You must have access to your existing inventory file with both master and external etcd host defined in their separate groups. 

. Ensure you have the latest version of the *openshift-ansible* packages
installed:
+
----
# yum upgrade openshift-ansible\*
----

The inventory is expected to have exactly one host in [etcd] group.
In most scenarios it's best just to use your existing master, there's no need for a separate host.

. Run the *_embedded2external.yml_* playbook using your inventory file:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory] \
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-etcd/embedded2external.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-etcd/embedded2external.yml
endif::[]

[[etcd-embedded-migration-manual]]
== Running the Manual Migration

Currently, the manual migration is not recommended as it requires a deployment
of new etcd cluster and re-deployment of etcd master certificates.
