== Overview

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Starting with OpenShift 3.0.2,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Starting with Origin 1.0.6,
endif::[]
if you installed using the
link:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation]
and the inventory file that was used is available, you can use the upgrade
playbook to automate the OpenShift cluster upgrade process.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick installation] method
and a *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* file is available, you can use
the installer to perform the automated upgrade.
endif::[]

The automated upgrade performs the following steps for you:

* Applies the latest configuration.
* Upgrades and restart master services.
* Upgrades and restart node services.
* Applies the latest cluster policies.
* Updates the default router if one exists.
* Updates the default registry if one exists.
* Updates default image streams and InstantApp templates.

[[running-upgrade-playbooks]]
== Running Upgrade Playbooks

Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
----

Then run one of the following upgrade playbooks utilizing the inventory file you
used during the advanced installation. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1

To upgrade from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *_v3_0_to_v3_1_* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to
link:#automated-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating Master and Node
Certificates].

[[upgrading-to-openshift-origin-1-1-z-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.1.z Releases

To upgrade an existing OpenShift Origin 1.1 cluster to the latest 1.1.z release,
run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook \
    [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_minor/upgrade.yml
----

[NOTE]
====
The *v3_1_minor* in the above path is a reference to the related OpenShift
Enterprise versions, however it is also the correct playbook to use when
upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.1 to the latest 1.1.z release.
====

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.

[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, on each master and
node host you must manually disable the 3.0 channel and enable the 3.1 channel:

====
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
====

For any upgrade path, always ensure that you have the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

There are two methods for running the automated upgrade:
link:#upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade[using the installer]
or link:#running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly[running the upgrade playbook
directly]. Choose and follow one method.

[[upgrading-using-the-installation-utility-to-upgrade]]
== Using the Installer to Upgrade

If you installed OpenShift using the
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html[quick installation] method,
you should have an installation configuration file located at
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_*. The installer requires this file to
start an upgrade.

[NOTE]
====
The installer currently only supports upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to
3.1. See
link:#upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-1-asynchronous-releases[Upgrading to
OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 Asynchronous Releases] for instructions on using
Ansible directly.
====

If you have an older format installation configuration file in
*_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* from an existing OpenShift Enterprise
3.0 installation, the installer will attempt to upgrade the file to the new
supported format. If you do not have an installation configuration file of any
format, you can
link:../../install_config/install/quick_install.html#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[create
one manually].

To start the upgrade, run the installer with the `upgrade` subcommand:

----
# atomic-openshift-installer upgrade
----

Then, follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade to the latest release. When
the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to
link:#automated-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating Master and Node
Certificates].

[[running-the-upgrade-playbook-directly]]
== Running the Upgrade Playbook Directly

Alternatively, you can run the upgrade playbook with Ansible directly, similar
to the advanced installation method, if you have an inventory file.

[[upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-0-1]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Enterprise 3.1.0

Before running the upgrade, first update your inventory file to change the
`*deployment_type*` parameter from *enterprise* to *openshift-enterprise*; this
is required when upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1:

----
# sed -i s/deployment_type=enterprise/deployment_type=openshift-enterprise/ </path/to/inventory/file>
----

Then, run the *_v3_0_to_v3_1_* upgrade playbook. If your inventory file is
located somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i`
flag to specify the location. If you previously used the
`atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your installation, you can check
*_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_* for the last inventory file that was
used, if needed.

----
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.
After rebooting, continue to
link:#automated-updating-master-and-node-certificates[Updating Master and Node
Certificates].

[[upgrading-to-openshift-enterprise-3-1-asynchronous-releases]]
=== Upgrading to OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 Asynchronous Releases

To apply
link:../../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.html#ose-31-asynchronous-errata-updates[asynchronous
errata updates], such as release 3.1.1, to an existing OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
cluster, first upgrade the *atomic-openshift-utils* package on the Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 system where you will be running Ansible:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

Then, run the *_v3_1_minor_* upgrade playbook. If your inventory file is located
somewhere other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to
specify the location. If you previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer`
command to run your installation, you can check
*_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_* for the last inventory file that was
used, if needed.

----
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_1_minor/upgrade.yml
----

When the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                 LABELS                                                                STATUS
master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
----
====

Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:

====
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.1.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.1.6",
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you upgraded from OSE 3.0 to OSE 3.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master_* and
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-node_* files.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you upgraded from Origin 1.0 to Origin 1.1, verify in your old
*_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/openshift-node_* files
that any custom configuration is added to your new
*_/etc/sysconfig/origin-master_* and *_/etc/sysconfig/origin-node_* files.
endif::[]


After upgrading, you can use the experimental diagnostics tool to look for
common issues:

====
----
# openshift ex diagnostics
...
[Note] Summary of diagnostics execution:
[Note] Completed with no errors or warnings seen.
