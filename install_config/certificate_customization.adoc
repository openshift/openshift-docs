== Overview
Administrators can configure custom serving certificates for the public hostnames of
the OpenShift API and link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console].

== Configuring Custom Certificates
`namedCertificates` may be listed in the `servingInfo` and `assetConfig.servingInfo` sections of the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master configuration file]
or in the `servingInfo` section of the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html#node-configuration-files[node configuration file].
Multiple certificates can be configured this way and each certificate may be associated with multiple
hostnames or wildcards.

A default certificate must be configured in the `servingInfo.certFile` and `servingInfo.keyFile`
configuration sections in addition to `namedCertificates`.

[NOTE]
====
`namedCertificates` should only be configured for the hostname associated with the
`publicMasterURL`. Using a custom serving certificate for the hostname associated
with the `masterURL` will result in TLS errors as infrastructure components will
attempt to contact the master API using the internal `masterURL` host.
