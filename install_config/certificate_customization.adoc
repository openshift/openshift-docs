== Overview
Administrators can configure custom serving certificates for the public host
names of the OpenShift API and
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].
This can be done during an
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-install-custom-certificates[advanced
installation] or configured after installation.

== Configuring Custom Certificates

The `*namedCertificates*` section may be listed in the `*servingInfo*` and
`*assetConfig.servingInfo*` sections of the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] or in the `*servingInfo*` section of the
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#node-configuration-files[node
configuration file]. Multiple certificates can be configured this way and each
certificate may be associated with multiple host names or wildcards.

A default certificate must be configured in the `*servingInfo.certFile*` and
`*servingInfo.keyFile*` configuration sections in addition to
`*namedCertificates*`.

[NOTE]
====
The `*namedCertificates*` section should only be configured for the host name
associated with the `*masterPublicURL*`, `*assetConfig.publicURL*`, and
`*oauthConfig.assetPublicURL*` settings. Using a custom serving certificate for
the host name associated with the `*masterURL*` will result in TLS errors as
infrastructure components will attempt to contact the master API using the
internal `*masterURL*` host.
