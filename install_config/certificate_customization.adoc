== Overview
Administrators can configure custom serving certificates for the public host
names of the {product-title} API and
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].
This can be done during a
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-custom-certificates[cluster installation] or configured after installation.

[[ansible-configuring-custom-certificates]]
== Configuring Custom Certificates During Installation

During cluster installations, custom certificates can be configured using the
`openshift_master_named_certificates` and
`openshift_master_overwrite_named_certificates` parameters, which are
configurable in the inventory file. More details are available about
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-custom-certificates[configuring custom certificates with Ansible].

[[configuring-custom-certificates]]
== Configuring Custom Certificates for the Web Console or CLI

You can specify custom certificates for the web console and for the CLI through the
`servingInfo` section of the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file]:

* The `servingInfo.namedCertificates` section serves up custom certificates for the web console. 
* The `servingInfo` section serves up custom certificates for the CLI and other API calls. 

You can configure multiple certificates this way, and each certificate can be associated with 
xref:configuring-custom-certificates-master[multiple host names], xref:configuring-custom-certificates-master[multiple routers], or the xref:configuring-custom-certificates-registry[{product-title} image registry].

A default certificate must be configured in the `servingInfo.certFile` and
`servingInfo.keyFile` configuration sections in addition to
`namedCertificates`.

[NOTE]
====
The `namedCertificates` section should be configured only for the host name
associated with the `masterPublicURL` and
`oauthConfig.assetPublicURL` settings n the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file. 
Using a custom serving certificate for
the host name associated with the `masterURL` will result in TLS errors as
infrastructure components will attempt to contact the master API using the
internal `masterURL` host.
====

The `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` and `openshift_master_cluster_hostname` parameters in the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file], by default `/etc/ansible/hosts`, must be different. If they are the same, the named certificates will fail and you will need to re-install them.

For more information on 
using DNS with {product-title}, see the xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#prereq-dns[DNS installation prerequisites].

This approach allows you to take advantage of the self-signed certificates generated by {product-title} and add custom trusted certificates to individual components as needed.

Note that the internal infrastructure certificates remain self-signed, which might be perceived as bad practice by some security or PKI teams. However, any risk here is minimal, as the only clients that trust these certificates are other components within the cluster. All external users and systems use custom trusted certificates.

Relative paths are resolved based on the location of the master configuration file. Restart
the server to pick up the configuration changes.

[[configuring-custom-certificates-master]]
== Configuring a Custom Master Host Certificate

In order to facilitate trusted connections with external users of {product-title}, you can provision a named certificate that matches the domain name provided in the `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` paramater in the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file], 
by default `/etc/ansible/hosts`. 

You must place this certificate in a directory accessible to Ansible and add the path in the 
Ansible inventory file, as follows:

----
openshift_master_named_certificates=[{"certfile": "/path/to/console.ocp-c1.myorg.com.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/console.ocp-c1.myorg.com.key", "names": ["console.ocp-c1.myorg.com"]}]
---- 

Where the parameter values are: 

* *certfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} router certificate.

* *keyfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} wildcard key.

* *names* is the cluster public hostname.

// * *cafile* contains the root CA for this key and certificate. If an intermediate CA is in use, it must contain both the intermediate and root CA. "cafile": "/path/to/console.ocp-c1.myorg.com.ca.crt"


The file paths must be local to the system where Ansible runs. Certificates
are copied to master hosts and are deployed within the
*_/etc/origin/master_* directory.

When securing the registry, add the service hostnames and IP addresses to the server certificate for the registry. 
The Subject Alternative Names (SAN) must contain the following.

* Two service hostnames:
+
----
docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local
docker-registry.default.svc            
----

* Service IP address. 
+
For example:
+
----
172.30.252.46
----
+
Use the following command to get the Docker registry service IP address: 
+
----
oc get service docker-registry --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----

* Public hostname. 
+
----
docker-registry-default.apps.example.com
----
+
Use the following command to get the Docker registry public hostname:
+
----  
oc get route docker-registry --template '{{.spec.host}}'
----

For example, the server certificate should contain SAN details similar to the following: 

----
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: 
               DNS:docker-registry-public.openshift.com, DNS:docker-registry.default.svc, DNS:docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local, DNS:172.30.2.98, IP Address:172.30.2.98
----

[[configuring-custom-certificates-wildcard]]
== Configuring a Custom Wildcard Certificate for the Default Router

You can configure the {product-title} default router with a default wildcard certificate. A default wildcard certificate provides a convenient way for 
applications that are deployed in {product-title} to use default encryption without needing custom certificates. 

[NOTE]
====
Default wildcard certificates are recommended for non-production environments only.
====

In order to configure a default wildcard certificate, provision a certificate that is valid for `.<app_domain>`, where `<app_domain>` is the value of `openshift_master_default_subdomain` in the xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[Ansible inventory file], by default `/etc/ansible/hosts`. Once provisioned, place the certificate, key, and ca certificate files on your Ansible host, and add the following line to your Ansible inventory file.

----
openshift_hosted_router_certificate={"certfile": "/path/to/apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com.key", "cafile": "/path/to/apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com.ca.crt"}
----

For example:

----
openshift_hosted_router_certificate={"certfile": "/home/cloud-user/star-apps.148.251.233.173.nip.io.cert.pem", "keyfile": "/home/cloud-user/star-apps.148.251.233.173.nip.io.key.pem", "cafile": "/home/cloud-user/ca-chain.cert.pem"}
----

Where the parameter values are: 

* *certfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} router certificate.

* *keyfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} wildcard key.

* *cafile* is the path to the file that contains the root CA for this key and certificate. If an intermediate CA is in use, the file should contain both the intermediate and root CA.

If these certificate files are new to your {product-title} cluster, run the Ansible *_deploy_router.yml_* playbook to add these files to the {product-title} configuration files. 
The playbook adds the certificate files to the *_/etc/origin/master/_* directory.

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-hosted/deploy_router.yml
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/inventory] \
    ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-hosted/deploy_router.yml
endif::[]
----

If xref:../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#redeploying-all-certificates-current-ca[the certificates are not new], 
for example, you want to change existing certificates or replace expired certificates, run the following playbook:

----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[NOTE] 
For this playbook to run, the certificate names must not change. If the certificate names change, rerun the Ansible *_deploy_cluster.yml_* playbook
as if the certificates were new.

[[configuring-custom-certificates-registry]]
== Configuring a Custom Certificate for the Image Registry

The {product-title} image registry is an internal service that facilitates builds and deployments. Most of the communication with the registry is handled by internal components in {product-title}. As such, you should not need to replace the certificate used by the registry service itself. 

However, by default, the registry uses routes to allow external systems and users to do pulls and pushes of images. You can use a _re-encrypt route_ with a custom certificate that is presented to external users instead of using the internal, self-signed certificate. 

To configure this, add the
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-configuring-docker-route[following lines]
of code to the `[OSEv3:vars]` section of the Ansible inventory file, by default
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file. Specify the certificates to use with the registry
route.

----
openshift_hosted_registry_routehost=registry.apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com <1>
openshift_hosted_registry_routecertificates={"certfile": "/path/to/registry.apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com.crt", "keyfile": "/path/to/registry.apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com.key", "cafile": "/path/to/registry.apps.c1-ocp.myorg.com-ca.crt"} <2>
openshift_hosted_registry_routetermination=reencrypt <3>
----

//https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/5765
<1> The host name of the registry.
<2> The locations of the *cacert*, *root*, and *cafile* files.
+
* *certfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} router certificate.

* *keyfile* is the path to the file that contains the {product-title} wildcard key.

* *cafile* is the path to the file that contains the root CA for this key and certificate. If an intermediate CA is in use, the file should contain both the intermediate and root CA.
<3> Specify where encryption is performed:
+
* Set to `reencrypt` with a _re-encrypt route_ to terminate encryption at the edge router and re-encrypt it with a new certificate supplied by the destination.
+
* Set to `passthrough` to terminate encryption at the destination. The destination is responsible for decrypting traffic.

[[configuring-custom-certificates-lb]]
== Configuring a Custom Certificate for a Load Balancer

If your {product-title} cluster uses the default load balancer or an enterprise-level load balancer, 
you can use custom certificates to make the web console and API available externally using a publicly-signed custom certificate. leaving the existing internal certificates for 
the internal endpoints.

To configure {product-title} to use custom certificates in this way:

. Edit the `servingInfo` section of the xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master configuration file]:
+
----
servingInfo:
  logoutURL: ""
  masterPublicURL: https://openshift.example.com:8443
  publicURL: https://openshift.example.com:8443/console/
  bindAddress: 0.0.0.0:8443
  bindNetwork: tcp4
  certFile: master.server.crt
  clientCA: ""
  keyFile: master.server.key
  maxRequestsInFlight: 0
  requestTimeoutSeconds: 0
  namedCertificates:
    - certFile: wildcard.example.com.crt <1>
      keyFile: wildcard.example.com.key <2>
      names:
        - "openshift.example.com"
  metricsPublicURL: "https://metrics.os.example.com/hawkular/metrics"
----
+
<1> Path to the certificate file for the web console.
+
<2> Path to the key file for the web console.
+
[NOTE]
====
Configure the  `namedCertificates` section for only the host name associated with the `masterPublicURL` and `oauthConfig.assetPublicURL` settings.  
Using a custom serving certificate for the host name associated with the `masterURL` causes in TLS errors as infrastructure components 
attempt to contact the master API using the internal masterURL host.
====

. Specify the `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname` and `openshift_master_cluster_hostname` paramaters in the Ansible inventory file, by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*. 
These values must be different. If they are the same, the named certificates will fail.
+
----
# Native HA with External LB VIPs
openshift_master_cluster_hostname=paas.example.com <1>
openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname=public.paas.example.com <2>
----
+
<1> The FQDN for internal load balancer configured for SSL passthrough.
+
<2> The FQDN for external the load balancer with custom (public) certificate.

For information specific to your load balancer environment, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/reference_architectures/?category=openshift%2520container%2520platform&version=current%2520release[the {product-title} Reference Architecture for your provider] and link:http://v1.uncontained.io/playbooks/installation/load_balancing.html#custom-certificate-ssl-termination-production[Custom Certificate SSL Termination (Production)].
