== Overview

// tag::installconfig_configuring_pipeline_execution[]

The first time a user creates a build configuration using the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[Pipeline]
build strategy, {product-title} looks for a template named
`*jenkins-ephemeral*` in the `*openshift*` namespace and instantiates it within
the user's project. The `*jenkins-ephemeral*` template that ships with
{product-title} creates, upon instantiation:

* a deployment configuration for Jenkins
  using the official {product-title} Jenkins image
* a service and route for accessing the Jenkins deployment
* a new Jenkins service account
* rolebindings to grant the service account edit access to the project

Cluster administrators can control what is created by either
modifying the content of the built-in template,
or by editing the cluster configuration
to direct the cluster to a different template location.

To modify the content of the default template:

----
$ oc edit template jenkins-ephemeral -n openshift
----

To use a different template, such as the `*jenkins-persistent*` template which uses persistent
storage for Jenkins, add the following to your master configuration file:

====
[source,yaml]
----
jenkinsPipelineConfig:
  autoProvisionEnabled: true <1>
  templateNamespace: openshift <2>
  templateName: jenkins-persistent <3>
  serviceName: jenkins-persistent-svc <4>
  parameters: <5>
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----
<1> Defaults to `true` if unspecified.
    If `false`, then no template will be instantiated.
<2> Namespace containing the template to be instantiated.
<3> Name of the template to be instantiated.
<4> Name of the service to be created by the template upon instantiation.
<5> Optional values to pass to the template during instantiation.
====

When a Pipeline build configuration is created, {product-title} looks for a
Service matching `*serviceName*`. This means `*serviceName*` must be chosen
such that it is unique in the project. If no Service is found, {product-title}
instantiates the `*jenkinsPipelineConfig*` template. If this is not desirable
(if you would like to use a Jenkins server external to {product-title}, for
example), there are a few things you can do, depending on who you are.

* If you are a cluster administrator, simply set `*autoProvisionEnabled*` to `*false*`.
  This will disable autoprovisioning across the cluster.
* If you are an unpriviledged user, a Service must be created for {product-title}
  to use. The service name must match the cluster configuration value of
  `*serviceName*` in the `*jenkinsPipelineConfig*`. The default value is
  `*jenkins*`. If you are disabling autoprovisioning because you are running a
  Jenkins server outside your project, it is recommended that you point this new
  service to your existing Jenkins server. See:
xref:../dev_guide/integrating_external_services.adoc#dev-guide-integrating-external-services[Integrating External Services]

The latter option could also be used to disable autoprovisioning in select
projects only.

== OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin

The OpenShift Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to provide a
readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich
interactions with an OpenShift API Server. The plugin leverages the OpenShift
command line tool (`oc`) which must be available on the nodes executing the
script.

For more information about installing and configuring the plugin, use the links
provided below that reference the official documentation.

== OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plugin

This Jenkins plugin keeps OpenShift BuildConfig and Build objects in sync with Jenkins Jobs and Builds.

The OpenShift jenkins Sync Plugin provides the following:

 * Dynamic job/run creation in Jenkins.
 * Dynamic creation of slave pod templates from ImageStreams, ImageStreamTags, or
 ConfigMaps.
 * Injecting of environment variables.
 * Pipeline visualization in the OpenShift web console.
 * Integration with the Jenkins git plugin, which passes commit information from
 OpenShift builds to the Jenkins git plugin.

For more information about this plugin, see:

 * https://github.com/openshift/jenkins-sync-plugin/blob/master/README.md[OpenShift Jenkins Sync Plug-in]
 * xref:../using_images/other_images/jenkins.adoc#sync-plug-in[{product-title} Sync Plug-in]
