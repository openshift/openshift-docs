== Overview

// tag::installconfig_configuring_pipeline_execution[]

The first time a user creates a build configuration using the
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#pipeline-build[Pipeline]
build strategy,
{product-title} looks for the a template named 
`*jenkins-ephemeral*` in the `*openshift*` namespace
and instantiates it within the user's project.
The `*jenkins-ephemeral*` template that ships with {product-title} creates,
upon instantiation:

* a deployment configuration for Jenkins
  using the official {product-title} Jenkins image
* a service and route for accessing the Jenkins deployment
* a new Jenkins service account
* rolebindings to grant the service account edit access to the project

Cluster administrators can control what is created by either
modifying the content of the built-in template,
or by editing the cluster configuration
to direct the cluster to a different template location.

To modify the content of the default template:

----
$ oc edit template jenkins-ephemeral -n openshift
----

To use a different template, such as the `*jenkins-persistent*` template which uses persistent
storage for Jenkins, add the following to your master configuration file:

====
[source,yaml]
----
jenkinsPipelineConfig:
  autoProvisionEnabled: true <1>
  templateNamespace: openshift <2>
  templateName: jenkins-pipeline <3>
  serviceName: jenkins-pipeline-svc <4>
  parameters: <5>
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
----
<1> Defaults to `true` if unspecified.
    If `false`, then no template will be instantiated.
<2> Namespace containing the template to be instantiated.
<3> Name of the template to be instantiated.
<4> Name of the service to be created by the template upon instantiation.
<5> Optional values to pass to the template during instantiation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When a Pipeline build configuration is created,
{product-title} instantiates the `*jenkinsPipelineConfig*` template *only if*
no existing service name in the project matches the `*serviceName*` field.
This means `*serviceName*` must be chosen such that it is unique in the project.
