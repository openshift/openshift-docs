== Overview

The default HAProxy router is intended to satisfy the needs of most users.
However, it does not expose all of the capability of HAProxy. Therefore, users
may need to modify the router for their own needs.

You may need to implement new features within the application back-ends, or
modify the current operation. The router plug-in provides all the facilities
necessary to make this customization.

The router pod uses a template file to create the needed HAProxy configuration
file. The template file is a link:http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[golang
template]. When processing the template, the router has access to
{product-title} information, including the router's deployment configuration, the
set of admitted routes, and some helper functions.

When the router pod starts, and every time it reloads, it creates an HAProxy
configuration file, and then it starts HAProxy. The
link:https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/configuration-1.5.html[HAProxy
configuration manual] describes all of the features of HAProxy and how to
construct a valid configuration file.

A xref:using-configmap-replace-template[*configMap*] can be used to add the new
template to the router pod. With this approach, the router deployment
configuration is modified to mount the *configMap* as a volume in the router
pod. The `TEMPLATE_FILE` environment variable is set to the full path name of
the template file in the router pod.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is not guaranteed that router template customizations will still work after
you upgrade {product-title}.

Also, router template customizations must be applied to the template version of
the router that is running.
====

Alternatively, you can build a custom router image and use it when
deploying some or all of your routers. There is no need for all routers to
run the same image. To do this, modify the *_haproxy-template.config_* file,
and xref:rebuilding-your-router[rebuild] the router image. The new image is
pushed to the cluster's Docker repository, and the router's deployment
configuration *image:* field is updated with the new name. When the cluster is
updated, the image needs to be rebuilt and pushed.

In either case, the router pod starts with the template file.

[[obtaining-router-configuration-template]]
== Obtaining the Router Configuration Template

The HAProxy template file is fairly large and complex. For some changes, it may
be easier to modify the existing template rather than writing a complete
replacement. You can obtain a *_haproxy-config.template_* file from a running
router by running this on master, referencing the router pod:

----
# oc get po
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
router-2-40fc3             1/1       Running   0          11d
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat haproxy-config.template > haproxy-config.template
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat haproxy.config > haproxy.config
----

Alternatively, you can log onto the node that is running the router:

----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# docker run --rm --interactive=true --tty --entrypoint=cat \
    registry.redhat.io/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v{product-version} haproxy-config.template
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# docker run --rm --interactive=true --tty --entrypoint=cat \
    openshift/origin-haproxy-router haproxy-config.template
endif::[]
----

The image name is from *container images*.

Save this content to a file for use as the basis of your customized template.
The saved *_haproxy.config_* shows what is actually running.


[[router-configuration-template]]
== Modifying the Router Configuration Template

[[router-template-background]]
=== Background

The template is based on the
link:https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/[golang template]. It can reference any
of the environment variables in the router's deployment configuration, any
configuration information that is described below, and router provided helper
functions.

The structure of the template file mirrors the resulting HAProxy configuration file.
As the template is processed, anything not surrounded by `{{" something "}}`
is directly copied to the configuration file. Passages that are surrounded by `{{"
something "}}` are evaluated. The resulting text, if any, is copied to the
configuration file.

[[go-template-actions]]
=== Go Template Actions

The *define* action names the file that will contain the processed template.

----
{{define "/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.config"}}pipeline{{end}}
----

.Template Router Functions
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Function | Meaning
|`*processEndpointsForAlias(alias ServiceAliasConfig, svc ServiceUnit, action string) []Endpoint*` |
Returns the list of valid endpoints. When action is "shuffle", the order of endpoints is randomized.
|`*env(variable, default ...string) string*` | Tries to get the named environment variable from the pod.
If it is not defined or empty, it returns the optional second argument. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.
|`*matchPattern(pattern, s string) bool*` | The first argument is a string that contains the regular
expression, the second argument is the variable to test. Returns a Boolean value indicating whether
the regular expression provided as the first argument matches the string provided as the second argument.
|`*isInteger(s string) bool*` | Determines if a given variable is an integer.
|`*firstMatch(s string, allowedValues ...string) bool*` | Compares a given string to a list of allowed
strings. Returns first match scanning left to right through the list.
|`*matchValues(s string, allowedValues ...string) bool*` | Compares a given string to a list of allowed
strings. Returns "true" if the string is an allowed value, otherwise returns false.
|`*generateRouteRegexp(hostname, path string, wildcard bool) string*` | Generates a regular expression
matching the route hosts (and paths). The first argument is the host name, the second is the path,
and the third is a wildcard Boolean.
|`*genCertificateHostName(hostname string, wildcard bool) string*` | Generates host name to use for
serving/matching certificates. First argument is the host name and the second is the wildcard Boolean.
|`*isTrue(s string) bool*` | Determines if a given variable contains "true".
|===

These functions are provided by the HAProxy template router plug-in.

[[router-info-for-templates]]
=== Router Provided Information

This section reviews the  {product-title} information that the router makes available to the
template. The router configuration parameters are the set of data that the
HAProxy router plug-in is given. The fields are accessed by `(dot) .Fieldname`.

The tables below the Router Configuration Parameters expand on the definitions
of the various fields. In particular, *.State* has the set of admitted routes.

.Router Configuration Parameters
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Field | Type | Description
|`*WorkingDir*` | string  | The directory that files will be written to,
defaults to *_/var/lib/containers/router_*
|`*State*` | `map[string](ServiceAliasConfig)` | The routes.
|`*ServiceUnits*` | `map[string]ServiceUnit` | The service lookup.
|`*DefaultCertificate*` | string | Full path name to the default
certificate in pem format.
|`*PeerEndpoints*` | `[]Endpoint` | Peers.
|`*StatsUser*` | string | User name to expose stats with (if the template
supports it).
|`*StatsPassword*` | string | Password to expose stats with (if the template
supports it).
|`*StatsPort*` | int | Port to expose stats with (if the template supports it).
|`*BindPorts*` | bool | Whether the router should bind the default ports.
|===

.Router ServiceAliasConfig (A Route)
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Field | Type | Description
|`*Name*` | string | The user-specified name of the route.
|`*Namespace*`| string | The namespace of the route.
|`*Host*` | string | The host name. For example, `www.example.com`.
|`*Path*` | string | Optional path. For example, `www.example.com/myservice`
where `myservice` is the path.
|`*TLSTermination*` | `routeapi.TLSTerminationType` | The termination policy for
this back-end; drives the mapping files and router configuration.
|`*Certificates*` | `map[string]Certificate` | Certificates used for securing
this back-end.  Keyed by the certificate ID.
|`*Status*` | `ServiceAliasConfigStatus` | Indicates the status of configuration
that needs to be persisted.
|`*PreferPort*` | string | Indicates the port the user wants to expose. If
empty, a port will be selected for the service.
|`*InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicy*` | `routeapi.InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicyType` |
Indicates desired behavior for insecure connections to an edge-terminated route: `none` (or `disable`), `allow`, or `redirect`.
|`*RoutingKeyName*` | string | Hash of the route + namespace name used to
obscure the cookie ID.
|`*IsWildcard*` | bool | Indicates this service unit needing wildcard support.
|`*Annotations*` | `map[string]string` | Annotations attached to this route.
|`*ServiceUnitNames*` | `map[string]int32` | Collection of services that support
this route, keyed by service name and valued on the weight attached to it with
respect to other entries in the map.
|`*ActiveServiceUnits*` | int | Count of the `ServiceUnitNames` with a non-zero weight.
|===

The `ServiceAliasConfig` is a route for a service.  Uniquely identified by
host + path. The default template iterates over routes using `{{range $cfgIdx, $cfg := .State }}`.
Within such a `{{range}}` block, the template can refer to any field of the
current `ServiceAliasConfig` using `$cfg.Field`.


.Router ServiceUnit
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Field | Type | Description
|`*Name*` | string | Name corresponds to a service name + namespace.
Uniquely identifies the `ServiceUnit`.
|`*EndpointTable*` | `[]Endpoint` | Endpoints that back the service. This translates into a final back-end
implementation for routers.
|===

`ServiceUnit` is an encapsulation of a service, the endpoints that back
that service, and the routes that point to the service.  This is the
data that drives the creation of the router configuration files

.Router Endpoint
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Field | Type
|`*ID*` | string
|`*IP*` | string
|`*Port*` | string

|Field | Type | Description
|`*Certificate*` | string | Represents a public/private key pair.  It is
identified by an ID, which will become the file name. A CA certificate will
not have a `PrivateKey` set.
|`*ServiceAliasConfigStatus*` | string | Indicates that the necessary
files for this configuration have been persisted to disk. Valid values: "saved", "".
|===

.Router Certificate Type
[cols="3*", options="header"]

|===
|Field | Type | Description
|`*TLSTerminationType*` | string | Dictates where the secure communication will stop.
|`*InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicyType*` | string | Indicates the desired behavior for insecure connections to a route. While
each router may make its own decisions on which ports to expose, this is normally port 80.
|===

`TLSTerminationType` and `InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicyType` dictate where the
secure communication will stop.


.Router TLSTerminationType Values
[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
|Constant | Value | Meaning
|`TLSTerminationEdge` | `edge` | Terminate encryption at the edge router.
|`TLSTerminationPassthrough` | `passthrough` | Terminate encryption at
the destination, the destination is responsible for decrypting traffic.
|`TLSTerminationReencrypt` | `reencrypt` | Terminate encryption at the edge
router and re-encrypt it with a new certificate supplied by the destination.
|===

.Router InsecureEdgeTerminationPolicyType Values

|`*Disable*` | No traffic is allowed on the insecure port.
|`*Redirect*` | Clients are redirected to the secure port.
|===

None (`""`) is the same as `Disable`.

[[using-annotations]]
=== Annotations

Each route can have annotations attached. Each annotation is just a name and a
value.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  annotations:
    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 5500ms
[...]
----

The name can be anything that does not conflict with existing
Annotations.  The value is any string. The string can have multiple tokens
separated by a space. For example, `aa bb cc`.  The template uses ``{{index}}`` to
extract the value of an annotation. For example:

----
{{$balanceAlgo := index $cfg.Annotations "haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance"}}
----

This is an example of how this could be used for mutual client authorization.

----
{{ with $cnList := index $cfg.Annotations "whiteListCertCommonName" }}
  {{   if ne $cnList "" }}
    acl test ssl_c_s_dn(CN) -m str {{ $cnList }}
    http-request deny if !test
  {{   end }}
{{ end }}
----

Then, you can handle the white-listed CNs with this command.

----
$ oc annotate route <route-name> --overwrite whiteListCertCommonName="CN1 CN2 CN3"
----

See xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#route-specific-annotations[Route-specific Annotations]
for more information.


[[using-env-var]]
=== Environment Variables

The template can use any environment variables that exist in the router pod. The
environment variables can be set in the deployment configuration. New
environment variables can be added.

They are referenced by the `env` function:

----
{{env "ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS" "20000"}}
----

The first string is the variable, and the second string is the default
when the variable is missing or `nil`. When `ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` is not
set or is `nil`, 20000 is used. Environment variables are a map where the key
is the environment variable name and the content is the value of the variable.

See xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#env-variables[Route-specific Environment variables]
for more information.


[[example-usage-customized-ha-proxy-touter]]
=== Example Usage

Here is a simple template based on the HAProxy template file.

Start with a comment:

----
{{/*
  Here is a small example of how to work with templates
  taken from the HAProxy template file.
*/}}
----

The template can create any number of output files. Use a define construct
to create an output file. The file name is specified as an argument to define,
and everything inside the define block up to the matching end is written as
the contents of that file.

----
{{ define "/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.config" }}
global
{{ end }}
----

The above will copy `global` to the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.config_* file,
and then close the file.

Set up logging based on environment variables.

----
{{ with (env "ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS" "") }}
  log {{.}} {{env "ROUTER_LOG_FACILITY" "local1"}} {{env "ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL" "warning"}}
{{ end }}
----

The `env` function extracts the value for the environment variable.  If the
environment variable is not defined or `nil`, the second argument is returned.

The with construct sets the value of "." (dot) within the with block to whatever
value is provided as an argument to with. The `with` action tests Dot for `nil`.
If not `nil`, the clause is processed up to the `end`. In the above, assume
`ROUTER_SYSLOG_ADDRESS` contains *_/var/log/msg_*, `ROUTER_LOG_FACILITY` is not
defined, and `ROUTER_LOG_LEVEL` contains `info`. The following will be copied to
the output file:

----
  log /var/log/msg local1 info
----

Each admitted route ends up generating lines in the configuration file. Use
`range` to go through the admitted routes:

----
{{ range $cfgIdx, $cfg := .State }}
  backend be_http_{{$cfgIdx}}
{{end}}
----

`.State` is a map of `ServiceAliasConfig`, where the key is the route name.
`range` steps through the map and, for each pass, it sets `$cfgIdx` with the
`key`, and sets `$cfg` to point to the `ServiceAliasConfig` that describes the
route. If there are two routes named `myroute` and `hisroute`, the above will
copy the following to the output file:

----
  backend be_http_myroute
  backend be_http_hisroute
----

Route Annotations, `$cfg.Annotations`, is also a map with the annotation name as
the key and the content string as the value. The route can have as many
annotations as desired and the use is defined by the template author. The user
codes the annotation into the route and the template author customized the
HAProxy template to handle the annotation.

The common usage is to index the annotation to get the value.

----
{{$balanceAlgo := index $cfg.Annotations "haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance"}}
----

The index extracts the value for the given annotation, if any.
Therefore, `$balanceAlgo` will contain the string associated with the annotation or `nil`.
As above, you can test for a non-`nil` string and act on it with the `with`
construct.

----
{{ with $balanceAlgo }}
  balance $balanceAlgo
{{ end }}
----

Here when `$balanceAlgo` is not `nil`, `balance $balanceAlgo` is copied to the
output file.

In a second example,  you want to set a server timeout based on a timeout value
set in an annotation.

----
$value := index $cfg.Annotations "haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout"
----

The `$value` can now be evaluated to make sure it contains a properly constructed
string.  The `matchPattern` function accepts a regular expression and returns
`true` if the argument satisfies the expression.

----
matchPattern "[1-9][0-9]*(us\|ms\|s\|m\|h\|d)?" $value
----

This would accept `5000ms` but not `7y`. The results can be used in a test.

----
{{if (matchPattern "[1-9][0-9]*(us\|ms\|s\|m\|h\|d)?" $value) }}
  timeout server  {{$value}}
{{ end }}
----

It can also be used to match tokens:

----
matchPattern "roundrobin|leastconn|source" $balanceAlgo
----

Alternatively `matchValues` can be used to match tokens:

----
matchValues $balanceAlgo "roundrobin" "leastconn" "source"
----

[[using-configmap-replace-template]]
== Using a ConfigMap to Replace the Router Configuration Template

You can use a xref:../../dev_guide/configmaps.adoc#dev-guide-configmaps[ConfigMap]
to customize the router instance without rebuilding the router image. The
*_haproxy-config.template_*, *_reload-haproxy_*, and other scripts can be
modified as well as creating and modifying router environment variables.

. Copy the *_haproxy-config.template_* that you want to modify as
xref:obtaining-router-configuration-template[described above]. Modify it as
desired.

. Create a ConfigMap:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create configmap customrouter --from-file=haproxy-config.template
----
+
The `customrouter` ConfigMap now contains a copy of the modified
*_haproxy-config.template_* file.

. Modify the router deployment configuration to mount the ConfigMap
as a file and point the `TEMPLATE_FILE` environment variable to it.
This can be done via `oc set env` and `oc set volume` commands,
or alternatively by editing the router deployment configuration.
+
Using `oc` commands::
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc set volume dc/router --add --overwrite \
    --name=config-volume \
    --mount-path=/var/lib/haproxy/conf/custom \
    --source='{"configMap": { "name": "customrouter"}}'
$ oc set env dc/router \
    TEMPLATE_FILE=/var/lib/haproxy/conf/custom/haproxy-config.template
----
+
Editing the Router Deployment Configuration::
+
Use `oc edit dc router` to edit the router deployment configuration
with a text editor.
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
...
        - name: STATS_USERNAME
          value: admin
        - name: TEMPLATE_FILE  <1>
          value: /var/lib/haproxy/conf/custom/haproxy-config.template
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-routerp
...
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        volumeMounts: <2>
        - mountPath: /var/lib/haproxy/conf/custom
          name: config-volume
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
...
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      volumes: <3>
      - configMap:
          name: customrouter
        name: config-volume
...
----
<1> In the `*spec.container.env*` field, add the `TEMPLATE_FILE` environment
variable to point to the mounted *_haproxy-config.template_* file.
<2> Add the `*spec.container.volumeMounts*` field to create the mount point.
<3> Add a new `*spec.volumes*` field to mention the ConfigMap.
====
+
Save the changes and exit the editor. This restarts the router.


[[using-stick-tables]]

== Using Stick Tables

The following example customization can be used in a
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#configuring-a-highly-available-service[highly-available
routing setup] to use stick-tables that synchronize between peers.

*Adding a Peer Section*

In order to synchronize stick-tables amongst peers you must a define a peers
section in your HAProxy configuration. This section determines how HAProxy will
identify and connect to peers. The plug-in provides data to the template under
the `*.PeerEndpoints*` variable to allow you to easily identify members of the
router service. You may add a peer section to the *_haproxy-config.template_*
file inside the router image by adding:

====
----
{{ if (len .PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }}
peers openshift_peers
  {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := .PeerEndpoints }}
    peer {{$endpoint.TargetName}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:1937
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
----
====

*Changing the Reload Script*

When using stick-tables, you have the option of telling HAProxy what it should
consider the name of the local host in the peer section. When creating
endpoints, the plug-in attempts to set the `*TargetName*` to the value of the
endpoint's `*TargetRef.Name*`. If `*TargetRef*` is not set, it will set the
`*TargetName*` to the IP address. The `*TargetRef.Name*` corresponds with the
Kubernetes host name, therefore you can add the `-L` option to the
`reload-haproxy` script to identify the local host in the peer section.

====
----
peer_name=$HOSTNAME <1>

if [ -n "$old_pid" ]; then
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name -sf $old_pid
else
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name
fi
----
<1> Must match an endpoint target name that is used in the peer section.
====

*Modifying Back Ends*

Finally, to use the stick-tables within back ends, you can modify the HAProxy
configuration to use the stick-tables and peer set. The following is an example
of changing the existing back end for TCP connections to use stick-tables:

====
----

            {{ if eq $cfg.TLSTermination "passthrough" }}
backend be_tcp_{{$cfgIdx}}
  balance leastconn
  timeout check 5000ms
  stick-table type ip size 1m expire 5m{{ if (len $.PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }} peers openshift_peers {{ end }}
  stick on src
                {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := $serviceUnit.EndpointTable }}
  server {{$endpointID}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:{{$endpoint.Port}} check inter 5000ms
                {{ end }}
            {{ end }}
----
====

After this modification, you can xref:rebuilding-your-router[rebuild your router].

[[rebuilding-your-router]]
== Rebuilding Your Router

In order to rebuild the router, you need copies of several files that are present
on a running router. Make a work directory and copy the files from the router:

----
# mkdir - myrouter/conf
# cd myrouter
# oc get po
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
router-2-40fc3             1/1       Running   0          11d
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat haproxy-config.template > conf/haproxy-config.template
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat error-page-503.http > conf/error-page-503.http
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat default_pub_keys.pem > conf/default_pub_keys.pem
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat ../Dockerfile > Dockerfile
# oc exec router-2-40fc3 cat ../reload-haproxy > reload-haproxy
----

You can edit or replace any of these files. However, *_conf/haproxy-config.template_*
and *_reload-haproxy_* are the most likely to be modified.

After updating the files:
----
# docker build -t openshift/origin-haproxy-router-myversion .
# docker tag openshift/origin-haproxy-router-myversion 172.30.243.98:5000/openshift/haproxy-router-myversion <1>
# docker push 172.30.243.98:5000/openshift/origin-haproxy-router-pc:latest <2>
----
<1> Tag the version with the repository. In this case the repository is
`172.30.243.98:5000`.
<2> Push the tagged version to the repository. It may be necessary to `docker
login` to the repository first.

To use the new router, edit the router deployment configuration either by
changing the *image:* string or by adding the `--images=<repo>/<image>:<tag>`
flag to the `oc adm router` command.

When debugging the changes, it is helpful to set `imagePullPolicy: Always`
in the deployment configuration to force an image pull on each pod creation. When
debugging is complete, you can change it back to `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`
to avoid the pull on each pod start.
