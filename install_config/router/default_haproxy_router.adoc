== Overview

The `oc adm router` command is provided with the administrator CLI to simplify
the tasks of setting up routers in a new installation. If you followed the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick
installation], then a default router was automatically created for you. The `oc
adm router` command creates the service and deployment configuration objects.
Use the `--service-account` option to specify the service account the router
will use to contact the master.

The
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[router
service account] can be created in advance or created by the `oc adm router
--service-account` command.

Every form of communication between {product-title} components is secured by TLS
and uses various certificates and authentication methods. The
`--default-certificate` .pem format file can be supplied or one is created by
the `oc adm router` command. When
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#[routes] are created, the user
can provide route certificates that the router will use when handling the route.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When deleting a router, ensure the deployment configuration, service, and secret
are deleted as well.
====

Routers are deployed on specific nodes. This makes it easier for the cluster
administrator and external network manager to coordinate which IP address will
run a router and which traffic the router will handle. The routers are deployed
on specific nodes by using xref:adding-nodeselector-to-a-deployment[node
selectors].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Routers use host networking by default, and they directly attach to port 80 and
443 on all interfaces on a host. Restrict routers to hosts where ports 80/443
are available and not being consumed by another service, and set this using
xref:adding-nodeselector-to-a-deployment[node selectors] and the
xref:../../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler
configuration]. As an example, you can achieve this by dedicating infrastructure
nodes to run services such as routers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use separate distinct *openshift-router* credentials
with your router. The credentials can be provided using the `--credentials`
flag to the `oadm router` command. Alternatively, the default cluster
administrator credentials can be used from the `$KUBECONFIG` environment
variable.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router --dry-run --service-account=router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' //<1>
----

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router --dry-run --service-account=router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} //<1>
----
endif::[]
<1> `--credentials` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file]
for the *openshift-router*.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
It is recommended using an *openshift-router* specific profile with
appropriate permissions.
endif::[]
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Router pods created using `oc adm router` have default resource requests
that a node must satisfy for the router pod to be deployed. In an
effort to increase the reliability of infrastructure components, the default
resource requests are used to increase the QoS tier of the router pods above
pods without resource requests. The default values represent the observed minimum
resources required for a basic router to be deployed and can be edited in the
routers deployment configuration and you may want to increase them based on the
load of the router.
====

[[deploy-router-create-router]]
== Creating a Router

The
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick
installation] process automatically creates a default router. If the router does
not exist, run the following to create a router:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc adm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oc adm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

`--replicas` is usually `1` unless a
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#[high availability] configuration
is  being created.

To find the host IP address of the router:

----
$ oc get po <router-pod>  --template={{.status.hostIP}}
----

You can also xref:creating-router-shards[use router shards] to ensure that the
router is filtered to specific namespaces or routes, or
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[set any
environment variables] after router creation. In this case create a router for each shard.

[[basic-router-commands]]
== Other Basic Router Commands

[[deploy-router-check-default]]
Checking the Default Router::

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The default router service account, named *router*, is automatically created during quick and advanced installations. To verify that this account already exists:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
First, ensure you have xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[created the
router service account] before deploying a router.

To check if a default router, named *router*, already exists:
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc adm router --dry-run --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oc adm router --dry-run --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

[[deploy-router-viewing-default]]
Viewing the Default Router::

To see what the default router would look like if created:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc adm router --dry-run -o yaml --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oc adm router --dry-run -o yaml --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

[[deploy-router-to-labeled-nodes]]
Deploying the Router to a Labeled Node::

To deploy the router to any node(s) that match a specified
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[node label]:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --selector=<label> \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router
----

For example, if you want to create a router named `router` and have it placed on a node labeled with `region=infra`:

----
$ oadm router router --replicas=1 --selector='region=infra' \
  --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
  --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --selector=<label> \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router
----

For example, if you want to create a router named `router` and have it placed on a node labeled with `region=infra`:

----
$ oadm router router --replicas=1 --selector='region=infra' \
  --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
  --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

During
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation],
the `*openshift_hosted_router_selector*` and `*openshift_registry_selector*`
Ansible settings are set to *region=infra* by default. The default router and
registry will only be automatically deployed if a node exists that matches the
*region=infra* label.

Multiple instances are created on different hosts according to the
xref:../../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler policy].

[[deploy-router-different-image]]
Using a Different Router Image::

To use a different router image and view the router configuration that would be used:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> -o <format> --images=<image> \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> -o <format> --images=<image> \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

For example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router region-west -o yaml --images=myrepo/somerouter:mytag \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router region-west -o yaml --images=myrepo/somerouter:mytag \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]

[[install-haproxy-filtering-routes]]
== Filtering Routes to Specific Routers

Using the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`ROUTE_LABELS`]
environment variable, you can filter routes so that they are used only by
specific routers.

For example, if you have multiple routers, and 100 routes, you can attach labels
to the routes so that a portion of them are handled by one router, whereas the
rest are handled by another.

. After xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#deploy-router-create-router[creating a router], use the `ROUTE_LABELS` environment variable to tag the router:
+
----
$ oc env dc/<router=name>  ROUTE_LABELS="key=value"
----

. Add the label to the desired routes:
+
----
oc label route <route=name> key=value
----

. To verify that the label has been attached to the route, check the route configuration:
+
----
$ oc describe dc/<route_name>
----


[[concurrent-connections]]
Setting the Maximum Number of Concurrent Connections::

The router can handle a maximum number of 20000 connections by default. You can
change that limit depending on your needs. Having too few connections prevents
the health check from working, which causes unnecessary restarts. You need to
configure the system to support the maximum number of connections. The limits
shown in `'sysctl fs.nr_open'` and `'sysctl fs.file-max'` must be large enough.
Otherwise, HAproxy will not start.

When the router is created, the `--max-connections=` option sets the desired
limit:

----
$ oc adm router --max-connections=10000   ....
----

Edit the xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS`] environment variable in the router's
deployment configuration to change the value. The router pods are restarted with
the new value. If `ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` is not present, the default value of
20000, is used.

[[bind-strict-sni]]
== HAProxy Strict SNI

The
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#bind-strict-sni[HAProxy `strict-sni`] can be
controlled through the `ROUTER_STRICT_SNI` environment variable in the router's
deployment configuration. It can also be set when the router is created by using the
`--strict-sni` command line option.

----
$ oc adm router --strict-sni
----

When the router is created the --max-connections= option sets the desired limit, 

====
----
$ oadm router --max-connections=10000   ....
----
====

The *ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS* environment variable in the router's deployment config can
be edited to change the value. The router pods are restarted with the new value.
If *ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS* is not present the default, 20000, is used.

[[bind-ciphers]]
== TLS Cipher Suites

The router
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#ciphers[cipher suite] can be
set when the router is created by using the --ciphers option.

----
$ oc adm router --ciphers=modern   ....
----

The values are: modern, intermediate, or old. The default is intermediate. Alternatively, a set
of ":" separated ciphers may be provided. The ciphers must be from the set displayed by:

----
$ openssl ciphers
----

Alternatively, the ROUTER_CIPHERS environment variable can be used.

[[highly-available-routers]]
== Highly-Available Routers

You can
xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[set
up a highly-available router] on your {product-title} cluster using IP failover.
This setup has multiple replicas on different nodes so the failover software can
switch to another replica if the current one fails.

[[customizing-the-router-service-ports]]
== Customizing the Router Service Ports
You can customize the service ports that a template router binds to by setting
the environment variables
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`*ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT*`]
and
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`*ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT*`].
This can be done by creating a template router, then editing its deployment
configuration.

The following example creates a router deployment with `0` replicas and
customizes the router service HTTP and HTTPS ports, then scales it
appropriately (to `1` replica).

====
----
$ oadm router --replicas=0 --ports='10080:10080,10443:10443' //<1>
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT=10080  \
                   ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT=10443
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----
<1> Ensures exposed ports are appropriately set for routers that use the
    container networking mode `--host-network=false`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do customize the template router service ports, you will also need to
ensure that the nodes where the router pods run have those custom ports opened
in the firewall (either via Ansible or `iptables`, or any other custom method
that you use via `firewall-cmd`).
====

The following is an example using `iptables` to open the custom router service
ports.

====
----
$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10080 -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10443 -j ACCEPT
----
====

[[working-with-multiple-routers]]
== Working With Multiple Routers

An administrator can create multiple routers with the same definition to serve
the same set of routes. Each router will be on a different
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#adding-nodeselector-to-a-deployment[node]
and will have a different IP address. The network administrator will need to get
the desired traffic to each node.

Multiple routers can be grouped to distribute routing load in the cluster and
separate tenants to different routers or
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[shards]. Each
router or shard in the group admits routes based on the selectors in the router.
An administrator can create shards over the whole cluster using
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`ROUTE_LABELS`].
A user can create shards over a namespace (project) by using
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`NAMESPACE_LABELS`].


[[adding-nodeselector-to-a-deployment]]
== Adding a Node Selector to a Deployment Configuration

Making specific routers deploy on specific nodes requires two steps:

1. Add a
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[label]
to the desired node:
+
----
$ oc label node 10.254.254.28 "router=first"
----

2. Add a node selector to the router deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc edit dc <deploymentConfigName>
----
+
Add the `template.spec.nodeSelector` field with a key and value
corresponding to the label:
+
====
----
...
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        router: router1
    spec:
      nodeSelector:      <1>
        router: "first"
...
----
<1> The key and value are `router` and `first`, respectively,
corresponding to the `router=first` label.
====

[[using-router-shards]]
== Using Router Shards

The access controls are based on the service account that the
router is run with.

Using
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`NAMESPACE_LABELS`]
and/or
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#env-variables[`ROUTE_LABELS`],
a router can filter out the namespaces and/or routes that it should admit.
This enables you to partition routes amongst multiple router deployments
effectively distributing the set of routes.

Example:
A router deployment `finops-router` is run with route selector
`NAMESPACE_LABELS="name in (finance, ops)"`
and a router deployment `dev-router` is run with route selector
`NAMESPACE_LABELS="name=dev"`.

If all routes are in the 3 namespaces `finance`, `ops` or `dev`,
then this could effectively distribute our routes across two
router deployments.

In the above scenario, sharding becomes a special case of partitioning
with no overlapping sets.
Routes are divided amongst multiple router shards.

The criteria for route selection governs how the routes are distributed.
It is possible to have routes that overlap accross multiple router deployments.

Example:
In addition to the `finops-router` and `dev-router` in the example
above, we also have an `devops-router` which is run with a route
selector `NAMESPACE_LABELS="name in (dev, ops)"`.

The routes in namespaces `dev` or `ops` now are serviced by two different
router deployments.
This becomes a case where we have partitioned the
routes with an overlapping set.

In addition, this enables us to create more complex routing rules ala
divert high priority traffic to the dedicated `finops-router` but send
the lower priority ones to the `devops-router`.

`NAMESPACE_LABELS` allows filtering the projects to service and selecting
all the routes from those projects.
But we may want to partition routes
based on other criteria in the routes themselves.
The `ROUTE_LABELS`
selector allows you to slice-and-dice the routes themselves.

Example:
A router deployment `prod-router` is run with route selector
`ROUTE_LABELS="mydeployment=prod"`
and a router deployment `devtest-router` is run with route selector
`ROUTE_LABELS="mydeployment in (dev, test)"`

Example assumes you have all the routes you wish to serviced tagged with a
label `"mydeployment=<tag>"`.

[[creating-router-shards]]
=== Creating Router Shards

Router sharding lets you select how routes are distributed among a set of
routers.

Router sharding is
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[based on labels];
you set labels on the routes in the pool,
and express the desired subset of those routes for the router to admit
with a selection expression via the `oc set env` command.

First, ensure that service account associated with the router has the
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[`cluster reader`] permission.

The rest of this section describes an extended example.
Suppose there are 26 routes, named `a` -- `z`,
in the pool, with various labels:

.Possible labels on routes in the pool
----
sla=high       geo=east     hw=modest     dept=finance
sla=medium     geo=west     hw=strong     dept=dev
sla=low                                   dept=ops
----

These labels express the concepts:
service level agreement, geographical location,
hardware requirements, and department.
The routes in the pool can have at most one label from each column.
Some routes may have other labels, entirely, or none at all.

[options="header",cols="1,1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
|Name(s) |SLA |Geo |HW |Dept |Other Labels

|`a`
|`high`
|`east`
|`modest`
|`finance`
|`type=static`

|`b`
|
|`west`
|`strong`
|
|`type=dynamic`

|`c`, `d`, `e`
|`low`
|
|`modest`
|
|`type=static`

|`g` -- `k`
|`medium`
|
|`strong`
|`dev`
|

|`l` -- `s`
|`high`
|
|`modest`
|`ops`
|

|`t` -- `z`
|
|`west`
|
|
|`type=dynamic`

|===

Here is a convenience script *_mkshard_*  that
illustrates how `oadm router`, `oc env`, and `oc scale`
work together to make a router shard.

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: mkshard ID SELECTION-EXPRESSION
id=$1
sel="$2"
router=router-shard-$id           //<1>
oc adm router $router --replicas=0  //<2>
dc=dc/router-shard-$id            //<3>
oc env   $dc ROUTE_LABELS="$sel"  //<4>
oc scale $dc --replicas=3         //<5>
----
<1> The created router has name `router-shard-<id>`.
<2> Specify no scaling for now.
<3> The deployment configuration for the router.
<4> Set the selection expression using `oc env`.
    The selection expression is the value of
    the `ROUTE_LABELS` environment variable.
<5> Scale it up.
====

Running *_mkshard_* several times creates several routers:

[options="header",cols="2,3,2"]
|===
|Router |Selection Expression |Routes

|`router-shard-1`
|`sla=high`
|`a`, `l` -- `s`

|`router-shard-2`
|`geo=west`
|`b`, `t` -- `z`

|`router-shard-3`
|`dept=dev`
|`g` -- `k`

|===


[[modifying-router-shards]]
=== Modifying Router Shards

Because a router shard is a construct
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[based on labels],
you can modify either the labels (via
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#application-modification-cli-operations[`oc label`])
or the selection expression.

This section extends the example started in the
xref:creating-router-shards[Creating Router Shards] section,
demonstrating how to change the selection expression.

Here is a convenience script *_modshard_* that modifies
an existing router to use a new selection expression:

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: modshard ID SELECTION-EXPRESSION...
id=$1
shift
router=router-shard-$id       //<1>
dc=dc/$router                 //<2>
oc scale $dc --replicas=0     //<3>
oc env   $dc "$@"             //<4>
oc scale $dc --replicas=3     //<5>
----
<1> The modified router has name `router-shard-<id>`.
<2> The deployment configuration where the modifications occur.
<3> Scale it down.
<4> Set the new selection expression using `oc env`.
    Unlike `mkshard` from the
    xref:creating-router-shards[Creating Router Shards]
    section, the selection expression specified as the
    non-`ID` arguments to `modshard` must include the
    environment variable name as well as its value.
<5> Scale it back up.
====

[NOTE]
====
In `modshard`, the `oc scale` commands are not necessary if the
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.adoc#strategies[deployment strategy]
for `router-dhsard-<id>` is `Rolling`.
====

For example, to expand the department for `router-shard-3`
to include `ops` as well as `dev`:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='dept in (dev, ops)'
----

The result is that `router-shard-3` now selects routes `g` -- `s`
(the combined sets of `g` -- `k` and `l` -- `s`).

This example takes into account that
there are only three departments in this example scenario,
and specifies a department to leave out of the shard,
thus achieving the same result as the preceding example:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='dept != finanace'
----

This example specifies shows three comma-separated qualities,
and results in only route `b` being selected:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='hw=strong,type=dynamic,geo=west'
----

Similarly to `ROUTE_LABELS`, which involve a route's labels,
you can select routes based on the labels of the route's namespace labels,
with the `NAMESPACE_LABELS` environment variable.
This example modifies `router-shard-3` to serve
routes whose namespace has the label `frequency=weekly`:

----
$ modshard 3 NAMESPACE_LABELS='frequency=weekly'
----

The last example combines `ROUTE_LABELS` and `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
to select routes with label `sla=low` and
whose namespace has the label `frequency=weekly`:

----
$ modshard 3 \
    NAMESPACE_LABELS='frequency=weekly' \
    ROUTE_LABELS='sla=low'
----

[[using-namespace-router-shards]]
=== Using Namespace Router Shards

The routes for a project can be handled by a selected router by using
`NAMESPACE_LABELS`.
The router is given a selector for a `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
label and the project that wants to use the router applies the `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
label to its namespace.

First, ensure that service account associated with the router has the
xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[`cluster
reader`] permission. This permits the router to read the labels that are applied
to the namespaces.

Now create and label the router:

----
$ oadm router ...  --service-account=router
$ oc env dc/router NAMESPACE_LABELS="router=r1"
----

Because the router has a selector for a namespace, the router will handle
routes for that namespace.  So, for example:

----
$ oc label namespace default "router=r1"
----

Now create routes in the default namespace, and the route is
available in the default router:

----
$ oc create -f route1.yaml
----

Now create a new project (namespace) and create a route, route2.

----
$ oc new-project p1
$ oc create -f route2.yaml
----

And notice the route is not available in your router.
Now label namespace p1 with "router=r1"

----
$ oc label namespace p1 "router=r1"
----

Which makes the route available to the router.

Note that removing the label from the namespace won't have immediate effect
(as we don't see the updates in the router), so if you redeploy/start a new
router pod, you should see the unlabelled effects.

----
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=0 && oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----


[[customizing-the-default-routing-subdomain]]
== Customizing the Default Routing Subdomain
You can customize the suffix used as the default routing subdomain for your
environment by modifying the
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file by
default). Routes that do not specify a host name would have one generated using
this default routing subdomain.

The following example shows how you can set the configured suffix
to *v3.openshift.test*:

====
----
routingConfig:
  subdomain: v3.openshift.test
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This change requires a restart of the master if it is running.
====

With the {product-title} master(s) running the above configuration, the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#route-hostnames[generated host
name] for the example of a route named *no-route-hostname* without a
host name added to a namespace *mynamespace* would be:

====
----
no-route-hostname-mynamespace.v3.openshift.test
----
====

[[forcing-route-hostnames-to-a-custom-routing-subdomain]]
== Forcing Route Host Names to a Custom Routing Subdomain
If an administrator wants to restrict all routes to a specific routing
subdomain, they can pass the `--force-subdomain` option to the `oc adm
router` command. This forces the router to override any host names specified in
a route and generate one based on the template provided to the
`--force-subdomain` option.

The following example runs a router, which overrides the route host names using
a custom subdomain template `${name}-${namespace}.apps.example.com`.

====
----
$ oc adm router --force-subdomain='${name}-${namespace}.apps.example.com'

[[using-wildcard-certificates]]
== Using Wildcard Certificates

A TLS-enabled route that does not include a certificate uses the router's
default certificate instead. In most cases, this certificate should be provided
by a trusted certificate authority, but for convenience you can use the
{product-title} CA to create the certificate. For example:

====
----
$ CA=/etc/origin/master
$ oc adm ca create-server-cert --signer-cert=$CA/ca.crt \
      --signer-key=$CA/ca.key --signer-serial=$CA/ca.serial.txt \
      --hostnames='*.cloudapps.example.com' \
      --cert=cloudapps.crt --key=cloudapps.key
----
====

The router expects the certificate and key to be in PEM format in a single
file:

====
----
$ cat cloudapps.crt cloudapps.key $CA/ca.crt > cloudapps.router.pem
----
====

From there you can use the `--default-cert` flag:

====
----
$ oadm router --default-cert=cloudapps.router.pem --service-account=router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Browsers only consider wildcards valid for subdomains one
level deep. So in this example, the certificate would be valid for
_a.cloudapps.example.com_ but not for _a.b.cloudapps.example.com_.
====

[[using-secured-routes]]
== Using Secured Routes

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts
for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process.
To remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
# openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----

Here is an example of how to use a secure edge terminated route with TLS
termination occurring on the router before traffic is proxied to the
destination. The secure edge terminated route specifies the TLS certificate
and key information. The TLS certificate is served by the router front end.

First, start up a router instance:

----
# oadm router --replicas=1 --service-account=router  \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"}
----

Next, create a private key, csr and certificate for our edge secured route.
The instructions on how to do that would be specific to your certificate
authority and provider. For a simple self-signed certificate for a domain
named `www.example.test`, see the example shown below:

----
# sudo openssl genrsa -out example-test.key 2048
#
# sudo openssl req -new -key example-test.key -out example-test.csr  \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Mountain View/O=OS3/OU=Eng/CN=www.example.test"
#
# sudo openssl x509 -req -days 366 -in example-test.csr  \
      -signkey example-test.key -out example-test.crt
----

Generate a route using the above certificate and key.

----
$ oc create route edge --service=my-service \
    --hostname=www.example.test \
    --key=example-test.key --cert=example-test.crt
route "my-service" created
----

Look at its definition.

----
$ oc get route/my-service -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name:  my-service
spec:
  host: www.example.test
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Make sure your DNS entry for `www.example.test` points to your router
instance(s) and the route to your domain should be available.
The example below uses curl along with a local resolver to simulate the
DNS lookup:

----
# routerip="4.1.1.1"  #  replace with IP address of one of your router instances.
# curl -k --resolve www.example.test:443:$routerip https://www.example.test/
----


[[using-wildcard-routes]]
== Using Wildcard Routes (for a Subdomain)

The HAProxy router has support for wildcard routes, which are enabled by setting
the `ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES` environment variable to `true`. Any routes
with a wildcard policy of `Subdomain` that pass the router admission checks will
be serviced by the HAProxy router. Then, the HAProxy router exposes the
associated service (for the route) per the route's wildcard policy.

----
$ oadm router --replicas=0 ...
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES=true
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----

.Using a Secure Wildcard Edge Terminated Route
This example reflects TLS termination occurring on the router before traffic is
proxied to the destination. Traffic sent to any hosts in the subdomain
`example.org` (`*.example.org`) is proxied to the exposed service.

The secure edge terminated route specifies the TLS certificate and key
information. The TLS certificate is served by the router front end for all hosts
that match the subdomain (`*.example.org`).

. Start up a router instance:
+
----
$ oadm router --replicas=0 --service-account=router
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_ALLOW_WILDCARD_ROUTES=true
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----

. Create a private key, certificate signing request (CSR), and certificate for the
edge secured route.
+
The instructions on how to do this are specific to your certificate authority
and provider. For a simple self-signed certificate for a domain named
`*.example.test`, see this example:
+
----
# sudo openssl genrsa -out example-test.key 2048
#
# sudo openssl req -new -key example-test.key -out example-test.csr  \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Mountain View/O=OS3/OU=Eng/CN=*.example.test"
#
# sudo openssl x509 -req -days 366 -in example-test.csr  \
      -signkey example-test.key -out example-test.crt
----

. Generate a wildcard route using the above certificate and key:
+
----
$ cat > route.yaml  <<REOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name:  my-service
spec:
  host: www.example.test
  wildcardPolicy: Subdomain
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: "$(perl -pe 's/\n/\\n/' example-test.key)"
    certificate: "$(perl -pe 's/\n/\\n/' example-test.cert)"
REOF
$ oc create -f route.yaml
----
+
Ensure your DNS entry for `*.example.test` points to your router instance(s) and
the route to your domain is available.
+
This example uses `curl` with a local resolver to simulate the DNS lookup:
+
----
# routerip="4.1.1.1"  #  replace with IP address of one of your router instances.
# curl -k --resolve www.example.test:443:$routerip https://www.example.test/
# curl -k --resolve abc.example.test:443:$routerip https://abc.example.test/
# curl -k --resolve anyname.example.test:443:$routerip https://anyname.example.test/

[[using-the-container-network-stack]]
== Using the Container Network Stack

The {product-title} router runs inside a container and the default behavior is
to use the network stack of the host (i.e., the node where the router container
runs). This default behavior benefits performance because network traffic from
remote clients does not need to take multiple hops through user space to reach
the target service and container.

Additionally, this default behavior enables the router to get the actual source
IP address of the remote connection rather than getting the node's IP address.
This is useful for defining ingress rules based on the originating IP,
supporting sticky sessions, and monitoring traffic, among other uses.

This host network behavior is controlled by the `--host-network` router command
line option, and the default behaviour is the equivalent of using
`--host-network=true`. If you wish to run the router with the container network
stack, use the `--host-network=false` option when creating the router. For
example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false
----
====
endif::[]

Internally, this means the router container must publish the 80 and 443
ports in order for the external network to communicate with the router.

[NOTE]
====
Running with the container network stack means that the router sees the source
IP address of a connection to be the NATed IP address of the node, rather than
the actual remote IP address.
====

[NOTE]
====
On {product-title} clusters using
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#network-isolation-multitenant[multi-tenant
network isolation], routers on a non-default namespace with the
`--host-network=false` option will load all routes in the cluster, but routes
across the namespaces will not be reachable due to network isolation. With the
`--host-network=true` option, routes bypass the container network and it can
access any pod in the cluster. If isolation is needed in this case, then do not
add routes across the namespaces.
====


[[exposing-the-router-metrics]]
== Exposing Router Metrics

Using the `--metrics-image` and `--expose-metrics` options, you can configure
the {product-title} router to run a sidecar container that exposes or publishes
router metrics for consumption by external metrics collection and aggregation
systems (e.g. Prometheus, statsd).

Depending on your router implementation, the image is appropriately set up and
the metrics sidecar container is started when the router is deployed. For
example, the HAProxy-based router implementation defaults to using the
`prom/haproxy-exporter` image to run as a sidecar container, which can then be
used as a metrics datasource by the Prometheus server.

[NOTE]
====
The `--metrics-image` option overrides the defaults for HAProxy-based router
implementations and, in the case of custom implementations, enables the image to
use for a custom metrics exporter or publisher.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Grab the HAProxy Prometheus exporter image from the Docker registry:
+
====
----
$ sudo docker pull prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====

. Create the {product-title} router:
+
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics
----
====
+
Or, optionally, use the `--metrics-image` option to override the HAProxy
defaults:
+
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics  \
    --metrics-image=prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Grab the HAProxy Prometheus exporter image from the Docker registry:
+
====
----
$ sudo docker pull prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====

. Create the {product-title} router:
+
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics
----
====
+
Or, optionally, use the `--metrics-image` option to override the HAProxy

    --service-account=router --expose-metrics  \
    --metrics-image=prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====
endif::[]

. Once the haproxy-exporter containers (and your HAProxy router) have started,
point Prometheus to the sidecar container on port 9101 on the node where the
haproxy-exporter container is running:
+
====
----
$ haproxy_exporter_ip="<enter-ip-address-or-hostname>"
$ cat > haproxy-scraper.yml  <<CFGEOF

[[preventing-connection-failures-during-restarts]]
== Preventing Connection Failures During Restarts

If you connect to the router while the proxy is reloading, there is a small
chance that your connection will end up in the wrong network queue and be
dropped. The issue is being addressed. In the meantime, it is possible to work
around the problem by installing `iptables` rules to prevent connections during
the reload window. However, doing so means that the router needs to run with
elevated privilege so that it can manipulate `iptables` on the host. It also
means that connections that happen during the reload are temporarily ignored and
must retransmit their connection start, lengthening the time it takes to
connect, but preventing connection failure.

To prevent this, configure the router to use `iptables` by changing the service
account, and setting an environment variable on the router.

*Use a Privileged SCC*

When creating the router, allow it to use the privileged SCC. This gives the
router user the ability to create containers with root privileges on the nodes:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----

*Patch the Router Deployment Configuration to Create a Privileged Container*

You can now create privileged containers. Next, configure the router deployment
configuration to use the privilege so that the router can set the iptables rules
it needs. This patch changes the router deployment configuration so that the
container that is created runs as privileged (and therefore gets correct
capabilities) and run as root:

----
$ oc patch dc router -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"router","securityContext":{"privileged":true}}],"securityContext":{"runAsUser": 0}}}}}'
----

*Configure the Router to Use iptables*

Set the option on the router deployment configuration:

====
----
$ oc set env dc/router -c router DROP_SYN_DURING_RESTART=true
----
====

If you used a non-default name for the router, you must change *_dc/router_*
accordingly.

[[deploy-router-arp-cach-tuning-for-large-scale-clusters]]
== ARP Cache Tuning for Large-scale Clusters

In {product-title} clusters with large numbers of routes (greater than the
value of `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3`, which is `1024` by default), you
must increase the default values of sysctl variables to allow more entries in
the ARP cache.

The kernel messages would be similar to the following:

----
[ 1738.811139] net_ratelimit: 1045 callbacks suppressed
[ 1743.823136] net_ratelimit: 293 callbacks suppressed
----

When this issue occurs, the `oc` commands might start to fail with the following
error:

----
Unable to connect to the server: dial tcp: lookup <hostname> on <ip>:<port>: write udp <ip>:<port>-><ip>:<port>: write: invalid argument
----

To verify the actual amount of ARP entries for IPv4, run the following:

----
# ip -4 neigh show nud all | wc -l
----

If the number begins to approach the `net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3`
threshold, increase the values. Run the following on the nodes running the
router pods. The following sysctl values are suggested for clusters with large
numbers of routes:

----
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 = 8192
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh2 = 32768
net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3 = 65536

[[deploy-router-protecting-against-ddos-attacks]]
== Protecting Against DDoS Attacks

Add *timeout http-request* to the default HAProxy router image to
protect the deployment against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (for
example, slowloris):

====
----
# and the haproxy stats socket is available at /var/run/haproxy.stats
global
  stats socket ./haproxy.stats level admin

defaults
  option http-server-close
  mode http
  timeout http-request 5s
  timeout connect 5s <1>
  timeout server 10s
  timeout client 30s
----
<1> *timeout http-request* is set up to 5 seconds. HAProxy gives a client 5 seconds
 *to send its whole HTTP request. Otherwise, HAProxy shuts the connection with
 *an error.
====

Also, when the environment variable `*ROUTER_SLOWLORIS_TIMEOUT*` is set, it
limits the amount of time a client has to send the whole HTTP request.
Otherwise, HAProxy will shut down the connection.

Setting the environment variable allows information to be captured as part
of the router's deployment configuration and does not require manual
modification of the template, whereas manually adding the HAProxy setting
requires you to rebuild the router pod and maintain your router template file.

Using annotations implements basic DDoS protections in the HAProxy template
router, including the ability to limit the:

* number of concurrent TCP connections
* rate at which a client can request TCP connections
* rate at which HTTP requests can be made

These are enabled on a per route basis because applications can have extremely
different traffic patterns.
