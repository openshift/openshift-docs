== Overview

The `oadm router` command is provided with the administrator CLI to simplify the
tasks of setting up routers in a new installation. If you followed the
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation], then
a default router was automatically created for you. The `oadm router` command
creates the service and deployment configuration objects. Just about every form
of communication between {product-title} components is secured by TLS and uses
various certificates and authentication methods. Use the `--credentials` option
to specify what credentials the router should use to contact the master.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Routers directly attach to port 80 and 443 on all interfaces on a host. Restrict
routers to hosts where port 80/443 is available and not being consumed by
another service, and set this using node selectors and the
xref:../../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler configuration]. As an example, you can
achieve this by dedicating infrastructure nodes to run services such as routers.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to use separate distinct *openshift-router* credentials
with your router. The credentials can be provided using the `--credentials`
flag to the `oadm router` command. Alternatively, the default cluster
administrator credentials can be used from the `$KUBECONFIG` environment
variable.

for the *openshift-router*.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
It is recommended using an *openshift-router* specific profile with
appropriate permissions.
endif::[]
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Router pods created using `oadm router` have default resource requests
that a node must satisfy for the router pod to be deployed. In an
effort to increase the reliability of infrastructure components, the default
resource requests are used to increase the QoS tier of the router pods above
pods without resource requests. The default values represent the observed minimum
resources required for a basic router to be deployed and can be edited in the
routers deployment configuration and you may want to increase them based on the
load of the router.

Checking the Default Router::

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The default router service account, named *router*, is automatically created during quick and advanced installations. To verify that this account already exists:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
First, ensure you have xref:creating-the-router-service-account[created the
router service account] before deploying a router.

To check if a default router, named *router*, already exists:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router --dry-run \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \

[[deploy-router-viewing-default]]
Viewing the Default Router::

To see what the default router would look like if created:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

----
endif::[]

[[deploy-router-create-router]]
Creating a Router::

The
xref:../../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#install-config-install-quick-install[quick installation]
process automatically creates a default router. To create a router if it does not exist:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

[[deploy-router-to-labeled-nodes]]
Deploying the Router to a Labeled Node::

To deploy the router to any node(s) that match a specified
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[node label]:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --selector=<label> \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router
----

For example, if you want to create a router named `router` and have it placed on a node labeled with `region=infra`:
----
$ oadm router router --replicas=1 --selector='region=infra' \
  --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
  --service-account=router
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ oadm router <router_name> --replicas=<number> --selector=<label> \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \

----

For example, if you want to create a router named `router` and have it placed on a node labeled with `region=infra`:
----
$ oadm router router --replicas=1 --selector='region=infra' \
  --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
  --service-account=router
----
endif::[]

During
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced installation],
the `*openshift_hosted_router_selector*` and `*openshift_registry_selector*`
Ansible settings are set to *region=infra* by default. The default router and
registry will only be automatically deployed if a node exists that matches the
*region=infra* label.

Multiple instances are created on different hosts according to the
xref:../../admin_guide/scheduler.adoc#admin-guide-scheduler[scheduler policy].

[[deploy-router-different-image]]
Using a Different Router Image::

To use a different router image and view the router configuration that would be used:

[[highly-available-routers]]
== Highly-Available Routers

You can xref:../../admin_guide/high_availability.adoc#admin-guide-high-availability[set up a highly-available
router] on your {product-title} cluster using IP failover.

[[customizing-the-router-service-ports]]
== Customizing the Router Service Ports
You can customize the service ports that a template router binds to by setting
the environment variables `*ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT*` and
`*ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT*`. This can be done by creating a template router,
then editing its deployment configuration.

The following example creates a router deployment with `0` replicas and
customizes the router service HTTP and HTTPS ports, then scales it
appropriately (to `1` replica).

====
----
$ oadm router --replicas=0 --ports='10080:10080,10443:10443' //<1>
$ oc env dc/router ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTP_PORT=10080  \
                   ROUTER_SERVICE_HTTPS_PORT=10443
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----
<1> Ensures exposed ports are appropriately set for routers that use the
    container networking mode `--host-network=false`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do customize the template router service ports, you will also need to
ensure that the nodes where the router pods run have those custom ports opened
in the firewall (either via Ansible or `iptables`, or any other custom method
that you use via `firewall-cmd`).
====

The following is an example using `iptables` to open the custom router service
ports.

====
----
$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10080 -j ACCEPT
$ iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 10443 -j ACCEPT
----
====


[[working-with-multiple-routers]]
== Working With Multiple Routers

An administrator can create multiple routers with the same definition
to serve the same set of routes.
By having different groups of routers with different namespace or
route selectors, they can vary the routes that the router serves.

Multiple routers can be grouped to distribute routing load in the cluster
and separate tenants to different routers or
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[shards].
Each router or shard in the group handles routes
based on the selectors in the router.
An administrator can create shards over the whole cluster using `ROUTE_LABELS`.
A user can create shards over a namespace (project) by using `NAMESPACE_LABELS`.


[[adding-nodeselector-to-a-deployment]]
== Adding a Node Selector to a Deployment Configuration

Making specific routers deploy on specific nodes requires two steps:

1. Add a
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[label]
to the desired node:
+
----
$ oc label node 10.254.254.28 "router=first"
----

2. Add a node selector to the router deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc edit dc <deploymentConfigName>
----
+
Add the `template.spec.nodeSelector` field with a key and value
corresponding to the label:
+
====
----
...
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        router: router1
    spec:
      nodeSelector:      <1>
        router: "first"
...
----
<1> The key and value are `router` and `first`, respectively,
corresponding to the `router=first` label.
====

[[using-router-shards]]
== Using Router Shards

The access controls are based on the service account that the
router is run with.

Using `NAMESPACE_LABELS` and/or `ROUTE_LABELS`, a router can filter out the
namespaces and/or routes that it should service.
This enables you to partition routes amongst multiple router deployments
effectively distributing the set of routes.

Example:
A router deployment `finops-router` is run with route selector
`NAMESPACE_LABELS="name in (finance, ops)"`
and a router deployment `dev-router` is run with route selector
`NAMESPACE_LABELS="name=dev"`.

If all routes are in the 3 namespaces `finance`, `ops` or `dev`,
then this could effectively distribute our routes across two
router deployments.

In the above scenario, sharding becomes a special case of partitioning
with no overlapping sets.
Routes are divided amongst multiple router shards.

The criteria for route selection governs how the routes are distributed.
It is possible to have routes that overlap accross multiple router deployments.

Example:
In addition to the `finops-router` and `dev-router` in the example
above, we also have an `devops-router` which is run with a route
selector `NAMESPACE_LABELS="name in (dev, ops)"`.

The routes in namespaces `dev` or `ops` now are serviced by two different
router deployments.
This becomes a case where we have partitioned the
routes with an overlapping set.

In addition, this enables us to create more complex routing rules ala
divert high priority traffic to the dedicated `finops-router` but send
the lower priority ones to the `devops-router`.

`NAMESPACE_LABELS` allows filtering the projects to service and selecting
all the routes from those projects.
But we may want to partition routes
based on other criteria in the routes themselves.
The `ROUTE_LABELS`
selector allows you to slice-and-dice the routes themselves.

Example:
A router deployment `prod-router` is run with route selector
`ROUTE_LABELS="mydeployment=prod"`
and a router deployment `devtest-router` is run with route selector
`ROUTE_LABELS="mydeployment in (dev, test)"`

Example assumes you have all the routes you wish to serviced tagged with a
label `"mydeployment=<tag>"`.

[[creating-router-shards]]
=== Creating Router Shards

Router sharding lets you select how routes are distributed among a set of
routers.

Router sharding is
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[based on labels];
you set labels on the routes in the pool,
and express the desired subset of those routes for the router to serve
with a selection expression via the `oc env` command.

First, ensure that service account associated with the router has the
xref:creating-the-router-service-account[`cluster reader`] permission.

The rest of this section describes an extended example.
Suppose there are 26 routes, named `a` -- `z`,
in the pool, with various labels:

.Possible labels on routes in the pool
----
sla=high       geo=east     hw=modest     dept=finance
sla=medium     geo=west     hw=strong     dept=dev
sla=low                                   dept=ops
----

These labels express the concepts:
service level agreement, geographical location,
hardware requirements, and department.
The routes in the pool can have at most one label from each column.
Some routes may have other labels, entirely, or none at all.

[options="header",cols="1,1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
|Name(s) |SLA |Geo |HW |Dept |Other Labels

|`a`
|`high`
|`east`
|`modest`
|`finance`
|`type=static`

|`b`
|
|`west`
|`strong`
|
|`type=dynamic`

|`c`, `d`, `e`
|`low`
|
|`modest`
|
|`type=static`

|`g` -- `k`
|`medium`
|
|`strong`
|`dev`
|

|`l` -- `s`
|`high`
|
|`modest`
|`ops`
|

|`t` -- `z`
|
|`west`
|
|
|`type=dynamic`

|===

Here is a convenience script *_mkshard_*  that
ilustrates how `oadm router`, `oc env`, and `oc scale`
work together to make a router shard.

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: mkshard ID SELECTION-EXPRESSION
id=$1
sel="$2"
router=router-shard-$id           //<1>
oadm router $router --replicas=0  //<2>
dc=dc/router-shard-$id            //<3>
oc env   $dc ROUTE_LABELS="$sel"  //<4>
oc scale $dc --replicas=3         //<5>
----
<1> The created router has name `router-shard-<id>`.
<2> Specify no scaling for now.
<3> The deployment configuration for the router.
<4> Set the selection expression using `oc env`.
    The selection expression is the value of
    the `ROUTE_LABELS` environment variable.
<5> Scale it up.
====

Running *_mkshard_* several times creates several routers:

[options="header",cols="2,3,2"]
|===
|Router |Selection Expression |Routes

|`router-shard-1`
|`sla=high`
|`a`, `l` -- `s`

|`router-shard-2`
|`geo=west`
|`b`, `t` -- `z`

|`router-shard-3`
|`dept=dev`
|`g` -- `k`

|===


[[modifying-router-shards]]
=== Modifying Router Shards

Because a router shard is a construct
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#router-sharding[based on labels],
you can modify either the labels (via
xref:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#application-modification-cli-operations[`oc label`])
or the selection expression.

This section extends the example started in the
xref:creating-router-shards[Creating Router Shards] section,
demonstrating how to change the selection expression.

Here is a convenience script *_modshard_* that modifies
an existing router to use a new selection expression:

====
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: modshard ID SELECTION-EXPRESSION...
id=$1
shift
router=router-shard-$id       //<1>
dc=dc/$router                 //<2>
oc scale $dc --replicas=0     //<3>
oc env   $dc "$@"             //<4>
oc scale $dc --replicas=3     //<5>
----
<1> The modified router has name `router-shard-<id>`.
<2> The deployment configuration where the modifications occur.
<3> Scale it down.
<4> Set the new selection expression using `oc env`.
    Unlike `mkshard` from the
    xref:creating-router-shards[Creating Router Shards]
    section, the selection expression specified as the
    non-`ID` arguments to `modshard` must include the
    environment variable name as well as its value.
<5> Scale it back up.
====

[NOTE]
====
In `modshard`, the `oc scale` commands are not necessary if the
xref:../../dev_guide/deployments.adoc#strategies[deployment strategy]
for `router-dhsard-<id>` is `Rolling`.
====

For example, to expand the department for `router-shard-3`
to include `ops` as well as `dev`:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='dept in (dev, ops)'
----

The result is that `router-shard-3` now selects routes `g` -- `s`
(the combined sets of `g` -- `k` and `l` -- `s`).

This example takes into account that
there are only three departments in this example scenario,
and specifies a department to leave out of the shard,
thus achieving the same result as the preceding example:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='dept != finanace'
----

This example specifies shows three comma-separated qualities,
and results in only route `b` being selected:

----
$ modshard 3 ROUTE_LABELS='hw=strong,type=dynamic,geo=west'
----

Similarly to `ROUTE_LABELS`, which involve a route's labels,
you can select routes based on the labels of the route's namespace labels,
with the `NAMESPACE_LABELS` environment variable.
This example modifies `router-shard-3` to serve
routes whose namespace has the label `frequency=weekly`:

----
$ modshard 3 NAMESPACE_LABELS='frequency=weekly'
----

The last example combines `ROUTE_LABELS` and `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
to select routes with label `sla=low` and
whose namespace has the label `frequency=weekly`:

----
$ modshard 3 \
    NAMESPACE_LABELS='frequency=weekly' \
    ROUTE_LABELS='sla=low'
----

[[using-namespace-router-shards]]
=== Using Namespace Router Shards

The routes for a project can be handled by a selected router by using
`NAMESPACE_LABELS`.
The router is given a selector for a `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
label and the project that wants to use the router applies the `NAMESPACE_LABELS`
label to its namespace.

First, ensure that service account associated with the router has the
xref:creating-the-router-service-account[`cluster reader`] permission.
This permits the router to read the labels that are applied to the namespaces.

Now create and label the router:

----
$ oadm router ...  --service-account=router
$ oc env dc/router NAMESPACE_LABELS="router=r1"
----

Because the router has a selector for a namespace, the router will handle
routes for that namespace.  So, for example:

----
$ oc label namespace default "router=r1"
----

Now create routes in the default namespace, and the route is
available in the default router:

----
$ oc create -f route1.yaml
----

Now create a new project (namespace) and create a route, route2.

----
$ oc new-project p1
$ oc create -f route2.yaml
----

And notice the route is not available in your router.
Now label namespace p1 with "router=r1"

----
$ oc label namespace p1 "router=r1"
----

Which makes the route available to the router.

Note that removing the label from the namespace won't have immediate effect
(as we don't see the updates in the router), so if you redeploy/start a new
router pod, you should see the unlabelled effects.

----
$ oc scale dc/router --replicas=0 && oc scale dc/router --replicas=1
----


[[customizing-the-default-routing-subdomain]]
== Customizing the Default Routing Subdomain
You can customize the suffix used as the default routing subdomain for your
environment by modifying the
xref:../../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file] (the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file by
default). Routes that do not specify a host name would have one generated using
this default routing subdomain.

The following example shows how you can set the configured suffix
to *v3.openshift.test*:

====
----
routingConfig:
  subdomain: v3.openshift.test
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This change requires a restart of the master if it is running.
====

With the {product-title} master(s) running the above configuration, the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#route-hostnames[generated host
name] for the example of a route named *no-route-hostname* without a
host name added to a namespace *mynamespace* would be:

====
----
no-route-hostname-mynamespace.v3.openshift.test
----
====

[[forcing-route-hostnames-to-a-custom-routing-subdomain]]
== Forcing Route Host Names to a Custom Routing Subdomain
If an administrator wants to restrict all routes to a specific routing
subdomain, they can pass the `--force-subdomain` option to the `oadm
router` command. This forces the router to override any host names specified in
a route and generate one based on the template provided to the
`--force-subdomain` option.

The following example runs a router, which overrides the route host names using
a custom subdomain template `${name}-${namespace}.apps.example.com`.

====
----
$ oadm router --force-subdomain='${name}-${namespace}.apps.example.com'
----
====

[[using-wildcard-certificates]]
== Using Wildcard Certificates

A TLS-enabled route that does not include a certificate uses the router's
default certificate instead. In most cases, this certificate should be provided
by a trusted certificate authority, but for convenience you can use the
{product-title} CA to create the certificate. For example:

====
----
$ CA=/etc/origin/master
$ oadm ca create-server-cert --signer-cert=$CA/ca.crt \
      --signer-key=$CA/ca.key --signer-serial=$CA/ca.serial.txt \
      --hostnames='*.cloudapps.example.com' \
      --cert=cloudapps.crt --key=cloudapps.key
----
====

The router expects the certificate and key to be in PEM format in a single
file:

====
----
$ cat cloudapps.crt cloudapps.key $CA/ca.crt > cloudapps.router.pem
----
====

From there you can use the `--default-cert` flag:

====
----
$ oadm router --default-cert=cloudapps.router.pem --service-account=router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Browsers only consider wildcards valid for subdomains one
level deep. So in this example, the certificate would be valid for
_a.cloudapps.example.com_ but not for _a.b.cloudapps.example.com_.
====

[[using-secured-routes]]
== Using Secured Routes

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts
for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process.
To remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

----
# openssl rsa -in <passwordProtectedKey.key> -out <new.key>
----

Here is an example of how to use a secure edge terminated route with TLS
termination occurring on the router before traffic is proxied to the
destination. The secure edge terminated route specifies the TLS certificate
and key information. The TLS certificate is served by the router front end.

First, start up a router instance:

----
# oadm router --replicas=1 --service-account=router  \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"}
----

Next, create a private key, csr and certificate for our edge secured route.
The instructions on how to do that would be specific to your certificate
authority and provider. For a simple self-signed certificate for a domain
named `www.example.test`, see the example shown below:

----
# sudo openssl genrsa -out example-test.key 2048
#
# sudo openssl req -new -key example-test.key -out example-test.csr  \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/L=Mountain View/O=OS3/OU=Eng/CN=www.example.test"
#
# sudo openssl x509 -req -days 366 -in example-test.csr  \
      -signkey example-test.key -out example-test.crt
----

Generate a route using the above certificate and key.

----
$ oc create route edge --service=my-service \
    --hostname=www.example.test \
    --key=example-test.key --cert=example-test.crt
route "my-service" created
----

Look at its definition.

----
$ oc get route/my-service -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name:  my-service
spec:
  host: www.example.test
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: my-service
  tls:
    termination: edge
    key: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      [...]
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      [...]
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Make sure your DNS entry for `www.example.test` points to your router
instance(s) and the route to your domain should be available.
The example below uses curl along with a local resolver to simulate the
DNS lookup:

----
# routerip="4.1.1.1"  #  replace with IP address of one of your router instances.
# curl -k --resolve www.example.test:443:$routerip https://www.example.test/
----


[[using-the-container-network-stack]]
== Using the Container Network Stack

The {product-title} router runs inside a Docker container and the default behavior is
to use the network stack of the host (i.e., the node where the router container
runs). This default behavior benefits performance because network traffic from
remote clients does not need to take multiple hops through user space to reach
the target service and container.

Additionally, this default behavior enables the router to get the actual source
IP address of the remote connection rather than getting the node's IP address.
This is useful for defining ingress rules based on the originating IP,
supporting sticky sessions, and monitoring traffic, among other uses.

This host network behavior is controlled by the `--host-network` router command
line option, and the default behaviour is the equivalent of using
`--host-network=true`. If you wish to run the router with the container network
stack, use the `--host-network=false` option when creating the router. For
example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false
----
====
endif::[]

Internally, this means the router container must publish the 80 and 443
ports in order for the external network to communicate with the router.

[NOTE]
====
Running with the container network stack means that the router sees the source
IP address of a connection to be the NATed IP address of the node, rather than
the actual remote IP address.
====

[NOTE]
====
On {product-title} clusters using
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#network-isolation-multitenant[multi-tenant
network isolation], routers on a non-default namespace with the
`--host-network=false` option will load all routes in the cluster, but routes
across the namespaces will not be reachable due to network isolation. With the
`--host-network=true` option, routes bypass the container network and it can
access any pod in the cluster. If isolation is needed in this case, then do not
add routes across the namespaces.

[[exposing-the-router-metrics]]
== Exposing Router Metrics

Using the `--metrics-image` and `--expose-metrics` options, you can configure
the {product-title} router to run a sidecar container that exposes or publishes
router metrics for consumption by external metrics collection and aggregation
systems (e.g. Prometheus, statsd).

Depending on your router implementation, the image is appropriately set up and
the metrics sidecar container is started when the router is deployed. For
example, the HAProxy-based router implementation defaults to using the
`prom/haproxy-exporter` image to run as a sidecar container, which can then be
used as a metrics datasource by the Prometheus server.

[NOTE]
====
The `--metrics-image` option overrides the defaults for HAProxy-based router
implementations and, in the case of custom implementations, enables the image to
use for a custom metrics exporter or publisher.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. Grab the HAProxy Prometheus exporter image from the Docker registry:
+
====
----
$ sudo docker pull prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====

. Create the {product-title} router:
+
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics
----
====
+
Or, optionally, use the `--metrics-image` option to override the HAProxy
defaults:
+
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics  \
    --metrics-image=prom/haproxy-exporter

. Create the {product-title} router:

----
$ oadm router \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \
    --service-account=router --expose-metrics
----
====
+

    --service-account=router --expose-metrics  \
    --metrics-image=prom/haproxy-exporter
----
====
endif::[]

. Once the haproxy-exporter containers (and your HAProxy router) have started,
point Prometheus to the sidecar container on port 9101 on the node where the
haproxy-exporter container is running:
+
====
----
$ haproxy_exporter_ip="<enter-ip-address-or-hostname>"
$ cat > haproxy-scraper.yml  <<CFGEOF
---
global:
  scrape_interval: "60s"
  scrape_timeout:  "10s"

  - job_name:  "haproxy"
    target_groups:
      - targets:
        - "${haproxy_exporter_ip}:9101"
CFGEOF

$ #  And start prometheus as you would normally using the above config file.
$ echo "  - Example:  prometheus -config.file=haproxy-scraper.yml "
$ echo "              or you can start it as a container on {product-title}!!

$ echo "  - Once the prometheus server is up, view the {product-title} HAProxy "
$ echo "    router metrics at: http://<ip>:9090/consoles/haproxy.html "

[[preventing-connection-failures-during-restarts]]
== Preventing Connection Failures During Restarts

If you connect to the router while the proxy is reloading, there is a small
chance that your connection will end up in the wrong network queue and be
dropped. The issue is being addressed. In the meantime, it is possible to work
around the problem by installing `iptables` rules to prevent connections during
the reload window. However, doing so means that the router needs to run with
elevated privilege so that it can manipulate `iptables` on the host. It also
means that connections that happen during the reload are temporarily ignored and
must retransmit their connection start, lengthening the time it takes to
connect, but preventing connection failure.

To prevent this, configure the router to use `iptables` by changing the service
account, and setting an environment variable on the router.

*Use a Privileged SCC*

When creating the router, allow it to use the privileged SCC. This gives the
router user the ability to create containers with root privileges on the nodes:

----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----

*Patch the Router Deployment Configuration to Create a Privileged Container*

You can now create privileged containers. Next, configure the router deployment
configuration to use the privilege so that the router can set the iptables rules
it needs. This patch changes the router deployment configuration so that the
container that is created runs as root:

----
$ oc patch dc router -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"router","securityContext":{"privileged":true}}]}}}}'
----

*Configure the Router to Use iptables*

Set the option on the router deployment configuration:

====
----
$ oc set env dc/router -c router DROP_SYN_DURING_RESTART=true
----
====

If you used a non-default name for the router, you must change *_dc/router_*
accordingly.


[[deploy-router-protecting-against-ddos-attacks]]
== Protecting Against DDoS Attacks

Add *timeout http-request* to the default HAProxy router image to
protect the deployment against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks (for
example, slowloris):

====
----
# and the haproxy stats socket is available at /var/run/haproxy.stats
global
  stats socket ./haproxy.stats level admin

defaults
  option http-server-close
  mode http
  timeout http-request 5s
  timeout connect 5s <1>
  timeout server 10s
  timeout client 30s
----
<1> *timeout http-request* is set up to 5 seconds. HAProxy gives a client 5 seconds
 *to send its whole HTTP request. Otherwise, HAProxy shuts the connection with
 *an error.
====

Also, when the environment variable `*ROUTER_SLOWLORIS_TIMEOUT*` is set, it
limits the amount of time a client has to send the whole HTTP request.
Otherwise, HAProxy will shut down the connection.

Setting the environment variable allows information to be captured as part
of the router's deployment configuration and does not require manual
modification of the template, whereas manually adding the HAProxy setting
requires you to rebuild the router pod and maintain your router template file.

Using annotations implements basic DDoS protections in the HAProxy template
router, including the ability to limit the:

* number of concurrent TCP connections
* rate at which a client can request TCP connections
* rate at which HTTP requests can be made

These are enabled on a per route basis because applications can have extremely
different traffic patterns.
