== About Routers

There are many ways to
xref:../../dev_guide/expose_service/index.adoc#getting-traffic-into-cluster-index[get traffic into the cluster].
The most common approach is to use the {product-title}
xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router]
as the ingress point for external traffic destined for
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services]
in your {product-title} installation.

{product-title} provides and supports the
following router plug-ins:

- The
xref:../../architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.adoc#architecture-haproxy-router[HAProxy template router]
is the default plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
image to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in inside a
container on {product-title}. It currently supports HTTP(S) traffic and
TLS-enabled traffic via SNI. The router's container listens on the host network
interface, unlike most containers that listen only on private IPs. The router
proxies external requests for route names to the IPs of actual pods identified
by the service associated with the route.

- The xref:../../architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.adoc#architecture-f5-big-ip[F5 router]
integrates with an existing *F5 BIG-IP®* system in your environment to
synchronize routes. *F5 BIG-IP®* version 11.4 or newer is required in order to
have the F5 iControl REST API.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The F5 router plug-in is available starting in {product-title} 3.0.2.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
== Router Service Account
Before deploying an {product-title} cluster, you must have a
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account]
for the router, which  is automatically created during cluster installation.
This service account has permissions to a
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security context constraint]
(SCC) that allows it to specify host ports.
// See NB[1] below.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== Configuring the Router Service Account
Router service account must have permissions to a
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraint] (SCC) that allows it to specify host ports.

To add a 'hostnetwork' SCC to the *router* service account in the *default* namespace:

----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user hostnetwork system:serviceaccount:default:router
----

[NOTE]
====
You can also use 'privileged' SCC for running your router, but it is recommended
to use only the necessary SCC for running router.
====

// See NB[1] below.
endif::[]


// NB[1]: The following blurb+codeblock is to both:
// - Configuring the Router Service Account (origin)
// - Router Service Account (enterprise)
// and both of these have anchor ‘creating-the-router-service-account’.

[[router-use-of-labels]]
=== Permission to Access Labels

When
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[namespace labels]
are used, for example in creating
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#using-router-shards[router shards],
the service account for the router must have `cluster-reader` permission.

----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:default:router
----

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise[]
With a service account in place, you can proceed to installing
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-default-haproxy[a
default HAProxy Router],
xref:../../install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-customized-haproxy[a
customized HAProxy Router] or
xref:../../install_config/router/f5_router.adoc#install-config-router-f5[F5
Router].
