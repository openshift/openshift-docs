== About Routers

The {product-title} xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[router] is
the ingress point for all external traffic destined for
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services]
in your {product-title} installation. {product-title} provides and supports the
following two router plug-ins:

- The
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#haproxy-template-router[HAProxy template router]
is the default plug-in. It uses the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*openshift3/ose-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*openshift/origin-haproxy-router*
endif::[]
image to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in inside a
container on {product-title}. It currently supports HTTP(S) traffic and
TLS-enabled traffic via SNI. The router's container listens on the host network
interface, unlike most containers that listen only on private IPs. The router
proxies external requests for route names to the IPs of actual pods identified
by the service associated with the route.

- The xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#f5-router[F5 router]
integrates with an existing *F5 BIG-IP®* system in your environment to
synchronize routes. *F5 BIG-IP®* version 11.4 or newer is required in order to
have the F5 iControl REST API.

[NOTE]
====
The F5 router plug-in is available starting in {product-title} 3.0.2.

== Router Service Account
Before deploying an {product-title} cluster, you must have a service account for the
router. Starting in {product-title} 3.1, a router
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account]
is automatically created during a quick or advanced installation (previously, this required manual creation). This service account has permissions to a
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security context constraint]
(SCC) that allows it to specify host ports.
// See NB[1] below.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
== Creating the Router Service Account
You must first create a
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account]
for the router before deploying. This service account must have permissions to a
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#security-context-constraints[security
context constraint] (SCC) that allows it to specify host ports.

To create a service account named *router* in the *default* namespace:

====
----
$ oc create serviceaccount router -n default
----
====

To add a privileged SCC to the *router* service account in the *default* namespace:

====
----
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:router
----
====
// See NB[1] below.
endif::[]


// NB[1]: The following blurb+codeblock is to both:
// - Creating the Router Service Account (origin)
// - Router Service Account (enterprise)
// and both of these have anchor ‘creating-the-router-service-account’.

Use of labels (e.g., to define xref:using-router-shards[router shards])
requires `cluster-reader` permission.

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:default:router
