== Overview

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The F5 router plug-in is available starting in {product-title} 3.0.2.
====
endif::[]

The F5 router plug-in is provided as a container image and run as a pod, just
like the
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-default-haproxy[default
HAProxy router].

[[install-router-f5-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

When deploying the F5 router plug-in, ensure you meet the following
requirements:

. An F5 host IP and credentials
. The name of the virtual servers (for both HTTP and HTTPS)
. The private key to the F5 instance
. The host-internal IP and VXLAN gateway
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Ensure you have xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[created the router service account].
endif::[]

[[f5-configuring-the-virtual-servcers]]
=== Configuring the Virtual Servers

As a prerequisite to working with the *openshift-F5* integrated router, two
virtual servers (one virtual server each for HTTP and HTTPS profiles,
respectively) need to be set up in the *F5 BIG-IP®* appliance.

To set up a virtual server in the *F5 BIG-IP®* appliance, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-basics-12-1-0/2.html[instructions
from F5].

While creating the virtual server, ensure the following settings are in place:

* For the HTTP server, set the `ServicePort` to `'http'/80`.
* For the HTTPS server, set the `ServicePort` to `'https'/443`.
* In the basic configuration, set the HTTP profile to *_/Common/http_* for both of
the virtual servers.
* For the HTTPS server, create a default *client-ssl* profile and select it for the *SSL Profile (Client)*.
** To create the default client SSL profile, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13452[instructions from F5], especially
the *Configuring the fallback (default) client SSL profile* section, which
discusses that the certificate/key pair is the default that will be served in
the case that custom certificates are not provided for a route or server name.

[[deploying-the-f5-router]]
== Deploying the F5 Router

[IMPORTANT]
====
The F5 router must be run in privileged mode, because route certificates are
copied using the `scp` command:

----
$ oc adm policy remove-scc-from-user hostnetwork -z router
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----
====

Deploy the F5 router with the `oadm router` command, but provide additional
flags (or environment variables) specifying the following parameters for the *F5
BIG-IP®* host:

[[f5-router-flags]]
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|`--type=f5-router`
|Specifies that an F5 router should be launched (the default `--type` is
*haproxy-router*).

|`--external-host`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* host's management interface's host name or IP
address.

|`--external-host-username`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* user name (typically *admin*).

|`--external-host-password`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* password.

|`--external-host-http-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for HTTP
connections. This must be configured by the user prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-https-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for
HTTPS connections. This must be configured by the user
prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-private-key`
|Specifies the path to the SSH private key file for the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.
Required to upload and delete key and certificate files for routes.

|`--external-host-insecure`
|A Boolean flag that indicates that the F5 router should skip strict certificate
verification with the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.

|`--external-host-partition-path`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* xref:f5-router-partition-paths[partition path] (the default is */Common*).
|===

For example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]

As with the HAProxy router, the `oadm router` command creates the service and
deployment configuration objects, and thus the replication controllers and
pod(s) in which the F5 router itself runs. The replication controller restarts
the F5 router in case of crashes. Because the F5 router is watching routes,
endpoints, and nodes and configuring *F5 BIG-IP®* accordingly, running the F5
router in this way, along with an appropriately configured *F5 BIG-IP®*
deployment, should satisfy high-availability requirements.

[[f5-router-partition-paths]]
== F5 Router Partition Paths
Partition paths allow you to store your {product-title} routing configuration in
a custom *F5 BIG-IP®* administrative partition, instead of the default */Common*
partition. You can use custom administrative partitions to secure *F5 BIG-IP®*
environments. This means that an {product-title}-specific configuration stored
in *F5 BIG-IP®* system objects reside within a logical container, allowing
administrators to define access control policies on that specific administrative
partition.

See the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos_management_guide_10_0_0/tmos_partitions.html[*F5 BIG-IP®* documentation] for more information about administrative partitions.

Use the `--external-host-partition-path` flag when
xref:deploying-the-f5-router[deploying the F5 router] to specify a partition
path:

----
$ oadm router --external-host-partition-path=/OpenShift/zone1 ...

[[setting-up-f5-native-integration-with-openshift]]
== Setting Up F5 Native Integration

[NOTE]
====
This section reviews how to set up F5 native integration with {product-title}.
The concepts of F5 appliance and {product-title} connection and data flow of F5
native integration are discussed in the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/routes.adoc#architecture-f5-native-integration[F5
Native Integration] section of the Routes topic.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
As of {product-title} version 3.4, using native integration of F5 with
{product-title} does not require configuring a ramp node for F5 to be able to
reach the pods on the overlay network as created by OpenShift SDN.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With native integration of F5 with {product-title}, you do not need to
configure a ramp node for F5 to be able to reach the pods on the overlay network
as created by OpenShift SDN.
endif::[]

The F5 controller pod needs to be launched with enough information so that it can
successfully directly connect to pods.

. Create a ghost `hostsubnet` on the {product-title} cluster:
+
----
$ cat > f5-hostsubnet.yaml << EOF
{
    "kind": "HostSubnet",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "openshift-f5-node",
        "annotations": {
        "pod.network.openshift.io/assign-subnet": "true",
	"pod.network.openshift.io/fixed-vnid-host": "0"  <1>
        }
    },
    "host": "openshift-f5-node",
    "hostIP": "10.3.89.213"  <2>
} EOF
$ oc create -f f5-hostsubnet.yaml
----
<1> Make F5 global.
<2> The internal IP of the F5 appliance.

. Determine the subnet allocated for the ghost `hostsubnet` just created:
+
----
$ oc get hostsubnets
NAME                    HOST                    HOST IP       SUBNET
openshift-f5-node       openshift-f5-node       10.3.89.213   10.131.0.0/23
openshift-master-node   openshift-master-node   172.17.0.2    10.129.0.0/23
openshift-node-1        openshift-node-1        172.17.0.3    10.128.0.0/23
openshift-node-2        openshift-node-2        172.17.0.4    10.130.0.0/23
----

. Check the `SUBNET` for the newly created `hostsubnet`. In this example,
`10.131.0.0/23`.

. Get the entire pod network’s CIDR:
+
----
$ oc get clusternetwork
----
+
This value will be something like `10.128.0.0/14`, noting the mask (`14` in
this example).

. To construct the gateway address, pick any IP address from the `hostsubnet`
(for example, `10.131.0.5`). Use the mask of the pod network (`14`). The
gateway address becomes: `10.131.0.5/14`.

. Launch the F5 controller pod, following xref:deploying-the-f5-router[these instructions].
Additionally, allow the access to 'node' cluster resource for the service account and
use the two new additional options for VXLAN native integration.
+
----
$ # Add policy to allow router to access nodes using the sdn-reader role
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:sdn-reader system:serviceaccount:default:router
$ # Launch the router pod with vxlan-gw and F5's internal IP as extra arguments
$ #--external-host-internal-ip=10.3.89.213
$ #--external-host-vxlan-gw=10.131.0.5/14
$ oadm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.3.89.90 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --credentials='/etc/openshift/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false \
    --external-host-internal-ip=10.3.89.213 \
    --external-host-vxlan-gw=10.131.0.5/14
----
+
The F5 setup is now ready, without the need to set up the ramp node.
