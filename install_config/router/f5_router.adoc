== Overview

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The F5 router plug-in is available starting in {product-title} 3.0.2.
====
endif::[]

The F5 router plug-in is provided as a Docker image and run as a pod, just like
the xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-default-haproxy[default HAProxy router]. Deploying the F5 router is
done similarly as well, using the `oadm router` command but providing additional
flags (or environment variables) to specify the following parameters for the *F5
BIG-IP®* host:

[[f5-router-flags]]
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|`--type=f5-router`
|Specifies that an F5 router should be launched (the default `--type` is
*haproxy-router*).

|`--external-host`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* host's management interface's host name or IP
address.

|`--external-host-username`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* user name (typically *admin*).

|`--external-host-password`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* password.

|`--external-host-http-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for HTTP connections.

|`--external-host-https-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for
HTTPS connections.

|`--external-host-private-key`
|Specifies the path to the SSH private key file for the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.
Required to upload and delete key and certificate files for routes.

|`--external-host-insecure`
|A Boolean flag that indicates that the F5 router should skip strict certificate
verification with the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.

|`--external-host-partition-path`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* xref:f5-router-partition-paths[partition path] (the default is */Common*).
|===

As with the HAProxy router, the `oadm router` command creates the service and
deployment configuration objects, and thus the replication controllers and
pod(s) in which the F5 router itself runs. The replication controller restarts
the F5 router in case of crashes. Because the F5 router is only watching routes
and endpoints and configuring *F5 BIG-IP®* accordingly, running the F5 router in
this way along with an appropriately configured *F5 BIG-IP®* deployment should
satisfy high-availability requirements.

[[deploying-the-f5-router]]
== Deploying the F5 Router

The F5 router must be run in privileged mode because route certificates get
copied using `scp`:

----
$ oadm policy remove-scc-from-user hostnetwork -z router
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----

To deploy the F5 router:

. First,
xref:../../install_config/routing_from_edge_lb.adoc#establishing-a-tunnel-using-a-ramp-node[establish
a tunnel using a ramp node], which allows for the routing of traffic to pods
through the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/sdn.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-sdn[{product-title} SDN].
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Ensure you have xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[created the router service account].
endif::[]
. Run the `oadm router` command with the xref:f5-router-flags[appropriate
flags]. For example:
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --credentials='/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig' \//<1>
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oadm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --credentials=${ROUTER_KUBECONFIG:-"$KUBECONFIG"} \//<1>
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
<1> `--credentials` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file]
for the *openshift-router*. It is recommended using an *openshift-router*
specific profile with appropriate permissions.

[[f5-router-partition-paths]]
== F5 Router Partition Paths
Partition paths allow you to store your {product-title} routing configuration in
a custom *F5 BIG-IP®* administrative partition, instead of the default */Common*
partition. You can use custom administrative partitions to secure *F5 BIG-IP®*
environments. This means that an {product-title}-specific configuration stored
in *F5 BIG-IP®* system objects reside within a logical container, allowing
administrators to define access control policies on that specific administrative
partition.

See the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos_management_guide_10_0_0/tmos_partitions.html[*F5 BIG-IP®* documentation] for more information about administrative partitions.

Use the `--external-host-partition-path` flag when
xref:deploying-the-f5-router[deploying the F5 router] to specify a partition
path:
====
----
$ oadm router --external-host-partition-path=/OpenShift/zone1 ...
----
====
