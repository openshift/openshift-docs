== Overview

[WARNING]
====
The F5 router plug-in will be deprecated in {product-title} version 3.11. The functionality of the F5 router plug-in is replaced in the F5 BIG-IP® Controller for OpenShift. For more information, see link:http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/openshift/[F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift]. For information about migrating existing deployments from the F5 router plug-in to the BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift, see
 link:http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/openshift/replace-f5-router.html[Replace the F5 Router with the F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift].
====

The F5 router plug-in is provided as a container image and run as a pod, just
like the
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-default-haproxy[default
HAProxy router].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Support relationships between F5 and Red Hat provide a full scope of support for both models of 
F5 integration, F5 router plug-in and the F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift. If you are currently using the F5 router plug-in, Red Hat support will provide the initial support and work with F5 support if necessary. If you are currently using the F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift, F5 will provide the inital support and work with Red Hat if necessary.
====

[[install-router-f5-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites and Supportability

When deploying the F5 router plug-in, ensure you meet the following
requirements:

* A F5 host IP with:
** Credentials for API access
** SSH access via a private key
* An F5 user with Advanced Shell access
* A virtual server for HTTP routes:
** _HTTP profile_ must be _http_.
* A virtual server with HTTP profile routes:
** _HTTP profile_ must be _http_
** _SSL Profile (client)_ must be _clientssl_
** _SSL Profile (server)_ must be _serverssl_
* For edge integration (not recommended):
** A working ramp node
** A working tunnel to the ramp node
* For native integration:
** A host-internal IP capable of communicating with all nodes on the port 4789/UDP
** The sdn-services add-on license installed on the F5 host.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure you have xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[created the router service account].
endif::[]

The F5 router plug-in for {product-title} supports only the following *F5 BIG-IP* versions:

* 11.x
* 12.x

The F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift supports the {product-title} versions found in the link:https://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/releases_and_versioning.html[F5 BIG-IP Controller for OpenShift releases and versioning]page in the F5 documentation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following features are not supported with *F5 BIG-IP* using the F5 router plug-in:

* Wildcard routes together with re-encrypt routes - you must supply a certificate and a key in the route. If you provide a certificate, a key, and a certificate authority (CA), the CA is never used.
* A pool is created for all services, even for the ones with no associated route.
* xref:../../admin_guide/idling_applications.adoc#admin-guide-idling-applications[Idling applications]
* Unencrypted HTTP traffic in _redirect_ mode, with edge TLS termination. (`insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect`)
* Sharding, that is, having multiple `vservers` on the F5.
* SSL cipher (`ROUTER_CIPHERS=modern/old`)
* Customizing the endpoint health checks for time-intervals and the type of checks.
* Serving F5 metrics by using a metrics server.
* Specifying a different target port (`PreferPort`/`TargetPort`) rather than the ones specified in the service.
* Customizing the source IP whitelists, that is, allowing traffic for a route only from specific IP addresses.
* Customizing timeout values, such as `max connect time`, or `tcp FIN timeout`.
* HA mode for the *F5 BIG-IP*.
====

[[f5-configuring-the-virtual-servers]]
=== Configuring the Virtual Servers

As a prerequisite to working with the F5 router plug-in, two
virtual servers (one virtual server each for HTTP and HTTPS profiles,
respectively) need to be set up in the *F5 BIG-IP* appliance.

To set up a virtual server in the *F5 BIG-IP* appliance, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-basics-12-1-0/2.html[instructions
from F5].

While creating the virtual server, ensure the following settings are in place:

* For the HTTP server, set the `ServicePort` to `'http'/80`.
* For the HTTPS server, set the `ServicePort` to `'https'/443`.
* In the basic configuration, set the HTTP profile to *_/Common/http_* for both of
the virtual servers.
* For the HTTPS server, create a default *client-ssl* profile and select it for the *SSL Profile (Client)*.
** To create the default client SSL profile, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13452[instructions from F5], especially
the *Configuring the fallback (default) client SSL profile* section, which
discusses that the certificate/key pair is the default that will be served in
the case that custom certificates are not provided for a route or server name.

[[deploying-the-f5-router]]
== Deploying the F5 Router Plug-in

[IMPORTANT]
====
The F5 router must be run in privileged mode, because route certificates are
copied using the `scp` command:

----
$ oc adm policy remove-scc-from-user hostnetwork -z router
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----
====

Deploy the F5 router plug-in with the `oc adm router` command, but provide additional
flags (or environment variables) specifying the following parameters for the *F5
BIG-IP* host:

[[f5-router-flags]]
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|`--type=f5-router`
|Specifies to launch an F5 router plug-in instead of the default haproxy-router. (the default `--type` is
*haproxy-router*).

|`--external-host`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP* host's management interface's host name or IP
address.

|`--external-host-username`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP* user name (typically *admin*).
The *F5 BIG-IP* user account must have access to the Advanced Shell (Bash) on the F5 BIG-IP system.

|`--external-host-password`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP* password.

|`--external-host-http-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for HTTP
connections. This must be configured by the user prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-https-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for
HTTPS connections. This must be configured by the user
prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-private-key`
|Specifies the path to the SSH private key file for the *F5 BIG-IP* host.
Required to upload and delete key and certificate files for routes.

|`--external-host-insecure`
|A Boolean flag that indicates that the F5 router plug-in does not use strict certificate
verification with the *F5 BIG-IP* host.

|`--external-host-partition-path`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* xref:f5-router-partition-paths[partition path] (the default is */Common*).
|===

For example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]

As with the HAProxy router, the `oc adm router` command creates the service and
deployment configuration objects, and thus the replication controllers and
pod(s) in which the F5 router plug-in itself runs. The replication controller restarts
the F5 router plug-in in case of crashes. Because the F5 router plug-in is watching routes,
endpoints, and nodes and configuring *F5 BIG-IP* accordingly, running the F5
router in this way, along with an appropriately configured *F5 BIG-IP*
deployment, satisfies high-availability requirements.

[[f5-router-partition-paths]]
== F5 Router Plug-in Partition Paths
Partition paths allow you to store your {product-title} routing configuration in
a custom *F5 BIG-IP* administrative partition, instead of the default */Common*
partition. You can use custom administrative partitions to secure *F5 BIG-IP*
environments. This means that an {product-title}-specific configuration stored
in *F5 BIG-IP* system objects reside within a logical container, allowing
administrators to define access control policies on that specific administrative
partition.

See the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos_management_guide_10_0_0/tmos_partitions.html[*F5 BIG-IP* documentation] for more information about administrative partitions.

To configure your {product-title} for partition paths:

. Optionally, perform some cleaning steps:
.. Ensure F5 is configured to be able to switch to the */Common* and */Custom* paths.
+
.. Delete the static FDB of `vxlan5000`. See
the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-implementations-12-0-0/9.html[F5
BIG-IP® documentation] for more information.

. xref:f5-configuring-the-virtual-servers[Configure a virtual server] for the
custom partition.

. To specify a partition path, deploy the F5 router plug-in using the `--external-host-partition-path` flag:
+
----
$ oc adm router --external-host-partition-path=/OpenShift/zone1 ...

[[setting-up-f5-native-integration-with-openshift]]
== Setting Up F5 Router Plug-in

[NOTE]
====
This section reviews how to set up F5 native integration with {product-title}.
The concepts of the F5 appliance and {product-title} connection and data flow of the F5
router plug-in are discussed in the
xref:../../architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.adoc#architecture-f5-native-integration[F5 Router Plug-in] section of the Routes topic.
====

[NOTE]
====
Only *F5 BIG-IP* appliance versions 11.x and 12.x work with the F5 router plug-in
presented in this section. You also need sdn-services add-on license for the
integration to work properly.
For version 11.x, follow the instructions to set up a
xref:../../install_config/routing_from_edge_lb.adoc#establishing-a-tunnel-using-a-ramp-node[_ramp
node_].
====


With F5 router plug-in for {product-title}, you do not need to
configure a ramp node for F5 to be able to reach the pods on the overlay network
as created by OpenShift SDN.

The F5 router plug-in pod needs to be launched with enough information so that it can
successfully directly connect to pods.

. Create a ghost `hostsubnet` on the {product-title} cluster:
+
----
$ cat > f5-hostsubnet.yaml << EOF
{
    "kind": "HostSubnet",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "openshift-f5-node",
        "annotations": {
        "pod.network.openshift.io/assign-subnet": "true",
	"pod.network.openshift.io/fixed-vnid-host": "0"  <1>
        }
    },
    "host": "openshift-f5-node",
    "hostIP": "10.3.89.213"  <2>
} EOF
$ oc create -f f5-hostsubnet.yaml
----
<1> Make F5 global.
<2> The internal IP of the F5 appliance.

. Determine the subnet allocated for the ghost `hostsubnet` just created:
+
----
$ oc get hostsubnets
NAME                    HOST                    HOST IP       SUBNET
openshift-f5-node       openshift-f5-node       10.3.89.213   10.131.0.0/23
openshift-master-node   openshift-master-node   172.17.0.2    10.129.0.0/23
openshift-node-1        openshift-node-1        172.17.0.3    10.128.0.0/23
openshift-node-2        openshift-node-2        172.17.0.4    10.130.0.0/23
----

. Check the `SUBNET` for the newly created `hostsubnet`. In this example,
`10.131.0.0/23`.

. Get the entire pod network’s CIDR:
+
----
$ oc get clusternetwork
----
+
This value will be something like `10.128.0.0/14`, noting the mask (`14` in
this example).

. To construct the gateway address, pick any IP address from the `hostsubnet`
(for example, `10.131.0.5`). Use the mask of the pod network (`14`). The
gateway address becomes: `10.131.0.5/14`.

. Launch the F5 router plug-in pod, following xref:deploying-the-f5-router[these instructions].
Additionally, allow the access to 'node' cluster resource for the service account and
use the two new additional options for VXLAN native integration.
