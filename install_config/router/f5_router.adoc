== Overview

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[NOTE]
====
The F5 router plug-in is available starting in {product-title} 3.0.2.
====
endif::[]

[WARNING]
====
The F5 router plug-in will be deprecated in {product_title} version 3.11. It
will be replaced by the F5 BIG-IP Controller. For more information, see link:http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/openshift/[F5 Container Connector - OpenShift]. For information about migrating to the BIG-IP Controller, see
link:http://clouddocs.f5.com/containers/v2/openshift/replace-f5-router.html[Replace the F5 Router in OpenShift].
====

The F5 router plug-in is provided as a container image and run as a pod, just
like the
xref:../../install_config/router/default_haproxy_router.adoc#install-config-router-default-haproxy[default
HAProxy router].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Support relationships between F5 and Red Hat provide a full scope of support for
F5 integration. F5 provides support for the *F5 BIG-IP®* product. Both F5 and
Red Hat jointly support the integration with Red Hat OpenShift. While Red Hat
helps with bug fixes and feature enhancements, all get communicated to F5
Networks where they are managed as part of their development cycles.
====

[[install-router-f5-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites and Supportability

When deploying the F5 router plug-in, ensure you meet the following
requirements:

* A F5 host IP with:
** Credentials for API access
** SSH access via a private key
* An F5 user with Advanced Shell access
* A virtual server for HTTP routes:
** _HTTP profile_ must be _http_.
* A virtual server with HTTP profile routes:
** _HTTP profile_ must be _http_
** _SSL Profile (client)_ must be _clientssl_
** _SSL Profile (server)_ must be _serverssl_
* For edge integration (not recommended):
** A working ramp node
** A working tunnel to the ramp node
* For native integration:
** A host-internal IP capable of communicating with all nodes on the port 4789/UDP
** The sdn-services add-on license installed on the F5 host.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
* Ensure you have xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#creating-the-router-service-account[created the router service account].
endif::[]

{product-title} supports only the following *F5 BIG-IP®* versions:

* 11.x
* 12.x

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following features are not supported with *F5 BIG-IP®*:

* Wildcard routes together with re-encrypt routes - you must supply a certificate and a key in the route. If you provide a certificate, a key, and a certificate authority (CA), the CA is never used.
* A pool is created for all services, even for the ones with no associated route.
* xref:../../admin_guide/idling_applications.adoc#admin-guide-idling-applications[Idling applications]
* Unencrypted HTTP traffic in _redirect_ mode, with edge TLS termination. (`insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect`)
* Sharding, that is, having multiple `vservers` on the F5.
* SSL cipher (`ROUTER_CIPHERS=modern/old`)
* Customizing the endpoint health checks for time-intervals and the type of checks.
* Serving F5 metrics by using a metrics server.
* Specifying a different target port (`PreferPort`/`TargetPort`) rather than the ones specified in the service.
* Customizing the source IP whitelists, that is, allowing traffic for a route only from specific IP addresses.
* Customizing timeout values, such as `max connect time`, or `tcp FIN timeout`.
* HA mode for the *F5 BIG-IP®*.
====

[[f5-configuring-the-virtual-servers]]
=== Configuring the Virtual Servers

As a prerequisite to working with the *openshift-F5* integrated router, two
virtual servers (one virtual server each for HTTP and HTTPS profiles,
respectively) need to be set up in the *F5 BIG-IP®* appliance.

To set up a virtual server in the *F5 BIG-IP®* appliance, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-basics-12-1-0/2.html[instructions
from F5].

While creating the virtual server, ensure the following settings are in place:

* For the HTTP server, set the `ServicePort` to `'http'/80`.
* For the HTTPS server, set the `ServicePort` to `'https'/443`.
* In the basic configuration, set the HTTP profile to *_/Common/http_* for both of
the virtual servers.
* For the HTTPS server, create a default *client-ssl* profile and select it for the *SSL Profile (Client)*.
** To create the default client SSL profile, follow the
link:https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13452[instructions from F5], especially
the *Configuring the fallback (default) client SSL profile* section, which
discusses that the certificate/key pair is the default that will be served in
the case that custom certificates are not provided for a route or server name.

[[deploying-the-f5-router]]
== Deploying the F5 Router

[IMPORTANT]
====
The F5 router must be run in privileged mode, because route certificates are
copied using the `scp` command:

----
$ oc adm policy remove-scc-from-user hostnetwork -z router
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z router
----
====

Deploy the F5 router with the `oc adm router` command, but provide additional
flags (or environment variables) specifying the following parameters for the *F5
BIG-IP®* host:

[[f5-router-flags]]
[cols="1,4"]
|===
|Flag |Description

|`--type=f5-router`
|Specifies that an F5 router should be launched (the default `--type` is
*haproxy-router*).

|`--external-host`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* host's management interface's host name or IP
address.

|`--external-host-username`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* user name (typically *admin*).
The *F5 BIG-IP* user account must have access to the Advanced Shell (Bash) on the F5 BIG-IP system.

|`--external-host-password`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* password.

|`--external-host-http-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for HTTP
connections. This must be configured by the user prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-https-vserver`
|Specifies the name of the F5 virtual server for
HTTPS connections. This must be configured by the user
prior to launching the router pod.

|`--external-host-private-key`
|Specifies the path to the SSH private key file for the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.
Required to upload and delete key and certificate files for routes.

|`--external-host-insecure`
|A Boolean flag that indicates that the F5 router should skip strict certificate
verification with the *F5 BIG-IP®* host.

|`--external-host-partition-path`
|Specifies the *F5 BIG-IP®* xref:f5-router-partition-paths[partition path] (the default is */Common*).
|===

For example:

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
$ oc adm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
====
----
$ oc adm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.0.0.2 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --host-network=false \
    --service-account=router
----
====
endif::[]

As with the HAProxy router, the `oc adm router` command creates the service and
deployment configuration objects, and thus the replication controllers and
pod(s) in which the F5 router itself runs. The replication controller restarts
the F5 router in case of crashes. Because the F5 router is watching routes,
endpoints, and nodes and configuring *F5 BIG-IP®* accordingly, running the F5
router in this way, along with an appropriately configured *F5 BIG-IP®*
deployment, should satisfy high-availability requirements.

[[f5-router-partition-paths]]
== F5 Router Partition Paths
Partition paths allow you to store your {product-title} routing configuration in
a custom *F5 BIG-IP®* administrative partition, instead of the default */Common*
partition. You can use custom administrative partitions to secure *F5 BIG-IP®*
environments. This means that an {product-title}-specific configuration stored
in *F5 BIG-IP®* system objects reside within a logical container, allowing
administrators to define access control policies on that specific administrative
partition.

See the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos_management_guide_10_0_0/tmos_partitions.html[*F5 BIG-IP®* documentation] for more information about administrative partitions.

To configure your {product-title} for partition paths:

. Optionally, perform some cleaning steps:
.. Ensure F5 is configured to be able to switch to the */Common* and */Custom* paths.
+
.. Delete the static FDB of `vxlan5000`. See
the
link:https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-implementations-12-0-0/9.html[*F5
BIG-IP®* documentation] for more information.

. xref:f5-configuring-the-virtual-servers[Configure a virtual server] for the
custom partition.

. Deploy the F5 router using the `--external-host-partition-path` flag to specify a partition path:
+
----
$ oc adm router --external-host-partition-path=/OpenShift/zone1 ...
----


[[setting-up-f5-native-integration-with-openshift]]
== Setting Up F5 Native Integration

[NOTE]
====
This section reviews how to set up F5 native integration with {product-title}.
The concepts of F5 appliance and {product-title} connection and data flow of F5
native integration are discussed in the
xref:../../architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.adoc#architecture-f5-native-integration[F5 Native Integration] section of the Routes topic.
====

[NOTE]
====
Only *F5 BIG-IP®* appliance version 12.x and above works with the native integration
presented in this section. You also need sdn-services add-on license for the
integration to work properly.
For version 11.x, follow the instructions to set up a
xref:../../install_config/routing_from_edge_lb.adoc#establishing-a-tunnel-using-a-ramp-node[_ramp
node_].
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
As of {product-title} version 3.4, using native integration of F5 with
{product-title} does not require configuring a ramp node for F5 to be able to
reach the pods on the overlay network as created by OpenShift SDN.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
With native integration of F5 with {product-title}, you do not need to
configure a ramp node for F5 to be able to reach the pods on the overlay network
as created by OpenShift SDN.
endif::[]

The F5 controller pod needs to be launched with enough information so that it can
successfully directly connect to pods.

. Create a ghost `hostsubnet` on the {product-title} cluster:
+
----
$ cat > f5-hostsubnet.yaml << EOF
{
    "kind": "HostSubnet",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "openshift-f5-node",
        "annotations": {
        "pod.network.openshift.io/assign-subnet": "true",
	"pod.network.openshift.io/fixed-vnid-host": "0"  <1>
        }
    },
    "host": "openshift-f5-node",
    "hostIP": "10.3.89.213"  <2>
} EOF
$ oc create -f f5-hostsubnet.yaml
----
<1> Make F5 global.
<2> The internal IP of the F5 appliance.

. Determine the subnet allocated for the ghost `hostsubnet` just created:
+
----
$ oc get hostsubnets
NAME                    HOST                    HOST IP       SUBNET
openshift-f5-node       openshift-f5-node       10.3.89.213   10.131.0.0/23
openshift-master-node   openshift-master-node   172.17.0.2    10.129.0.0/23
openshift-node-1        openshift-node-1        172.17.0.3    10.128.0.0/23
openshift-node-2        openshift-node-2        172.17.0.4    10.130.0.0/23
----

. Check the `SUBNET` for the newly created `hostsubnet`. In this example,
`10.131.0.0/23`.

. Get the entire pod network’s CIDR:
+
----
$ oc get clusternetwork
----
+
This value will be something like `10.128.0.0/14`, noting the mask (`14` in
this example).

. To construct the gateway address, pick any IP address from the `hostsubnet`
(for example, `10.131.0.5`). Use the mask of the pod network (`14`). The
gateway address becomes: `10.131.0.5/14`.

. Launch the F5 controller pod, following xref:deploying-the-f5-router[these instructions].
Additionally, allow the access to 'node' cluster resource for the service account and
use the two new additional options for VXLAN native integration.
+
----
$ # Add policy to allow router to access nodes using the sdn-reader role
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:sdn-reader system:serviceaccount:default:router
$ # Launch the router pod with vxlan-gw and F5's internal IP as extra arguments
$ #--external-host-internal-ip=10.3.89.213
$ #--external-host-vxlan-gw=10.131.0.5/14
$ oc adm router \
    --type=f5-router \
    --external-host=10.3.89.90 \
    --external-host-username=admin \
    --external-host-password=mypassword \
    --external-host-http-vserver=ose-vserver \
    --external-host-https-vserver=https-ose-vserver \
    --external-host-private-key=/path/to/key \
    --service-account=router \
    --host-network=false \
    --external-host-internal-ip=10.3.89.213 \
    --external-host-vxlan-gw=10.131.0.5/14
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `external-host-username` is a *F5 BIG-IP* user account with access to the Advanced Shell (Bash) on the F5 BIG-IP system.
====

The F5 setup is now ready, without the need to set up the ramp node.
