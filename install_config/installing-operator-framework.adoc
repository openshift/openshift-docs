Red Hat has announced the
link:https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operator-framework[Operator Framework],
an open source toolkit designed to manage Kubernetes native applications, called
_Operators_, in a more effective, automated, and scalable way.

The following sections provide instructions for trying out the Technology
Preview Operator Framework in {product-title} 3.11 as a cluster administrator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Operator Framework is a Technology Preview feature.
Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service
level agreements (SLAs), might not be functionally complete, and Red Hat does
not recommend to use them for production. These features provide early access to
upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide
feedback during the development process.

For more information on Red Hat Technology Preview features support scope, see
https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/.

== What's in the Technology Preview?

The Technology Preview Operator Framework installs the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)],
which aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access
to Operators running on their {product-title} cluster.

The {product-title} web console is also updated with new management screens for
cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects
access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring
instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be
subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.

.Operator Catalog Sources
image::olm-catalog-sources.png[]

In the screenshot, you can see the pre-loaded catalog sources of partner
Operators from leading software vendors:

Couchbase Operator:: Couchbase offers a NoSQL database that provides a mechanism
for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the
tabular relations used in relational databases. Available on {product-title}
3.11 as a developer preview, supported by Couchbase, the Operator allows you to
run Couchbase deployments natively on {product-title}. It installs and can more
effectively failover your NoSQL clusters.

Dynatrace Operator:: Dynatrace application monitoring provides performance
metrics in real time and can help detect and diagnose problems automatically.
The Operator will more easily install the container-focused monitoring stack and
connect it back to the Dynatrace monitoring cloud, watching custom resources and
monitoring desired states constantly.

MongoDB Operator:: MongoDB is a distributed, transactional database that stores
data in flexible, JSON-like documents. The Operator supports deploying both
production-ready replica sets and sharded clusters, and standalone dev/test
instances. It works in conjunction with MongoDB Ops Manager, ensuring all
clusters are deployed according to operational best practices.

Also included are the following Red Hat-provided Operators:

Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator:: Red Hat AMQ Streams is a massively scalable,
distributed, and high performance data streaming platform based on the Apache
Kafka project. It offers a distributed backbone that allows microservices and
other applications to share data with extremely high throughput and extremely
low latency.

etcd Operator:: etcd is a distributed key-value store that provides a reliable
way to store data across a cluster of machines. This Operator enables users to
configure and manage the complexities of etcd using a simple declarative
configuration that creates, configures, and manages etcd clusters.

Prometheus Operator:: Prometheus is a cloud native monitoring system co-hosted
with Kubernetes within the CNCF. This Operator includes application domain
knowledge to take care of common tasks like create/destroy, simple
configuration, automatic generating of monitoring target configurations via
labels, and more.
