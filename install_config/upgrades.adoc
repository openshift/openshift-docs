== Overview
When new versions of OpenShift are released, you can upgrade your cluster to
apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub  to
review the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
See the link:../whats_new/ose_3_0_release_notes.html[OpenShift Enterprise 3.0
Release Notes] to review the latest changes.
endif::[]

To upgrade your OpenShift cluster without disruption, it is important to upgrade
components as documented in this topic. Before you begin your upgrade,
familiarize yourself with the entire procedure.
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases] may require
additional steps to be performed at key points during the standard upgrade
process.

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

[NOTE]
====
This topic pertains to RPM-based installations only
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
(i.e., the link:install/quick_install.html[quick] and link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] methods)
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
(i.e., the link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method)

 and does
not currently cover container-based installations.
====

[[upgrading-masters]]

== Upgrading Masters
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the *openshift-master*
package:

----
# yum upgrade openshift-master
----

Then, restart the *openshift-master* service and review its logs to ensure
services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u openshift-master
----

[[updating-policy-definitions]]

== Updating Policy Definitions
After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default
cluster roles] may have been updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy by running:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]

== Upgrading Nodes
After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
*openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
connectivity from running pods to services while the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

On each node host, upgrade all *openshift* packages:

----
# yum upgrade openshift\*
----

Then, restart the *openshift-node* service:

----
# systemctl restart openshift-node
----

As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, verify that all nodes are showing as
*Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS
master.example.com      kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com     Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready
node2.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com      Ready

[[upgrading-the-router]]

== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously link:install/deploy_router.html[deployed a router], the
router deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in
the router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must
have previously deployed a
link:high_availability.html#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
OpenShift Origin 1.0.4, first see the
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Instructions per Release]
section for important steps link:#openshift-origin-1-0-4[specific to this
upgrade],
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.1.0, first see the
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Instructions per Release]
section for important steps link:#openshift-enterprise-3-0-1-0[specific to this
upgrade],
endif::[]
then continue with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
..
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ..
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.0.1.0 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ..
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]

== Upgrading the Registry
The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry. The
link:install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[registry
installation] topic details how to configure persistent storage.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

====
----
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ..
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.0.1.0 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ..
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]

== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates
By default, the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
link:install/quick_install.html[quick installation] and
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] methods automatically
create
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method automatically
creates
endif::[]
default image streams, QuickStart templates, and database service templates in
the *openshift* project, which is a default project to which all users have view
access. These objects were created during installation from the JSON files
located under *_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*. Running the latest installer
will copy newer files into place, but it does not currently update the
*openshift* project.

You can update the *openshift* project by running the following commands. It is
expected that you will receive warnings about items that already exist.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
====
----
# oc create -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/image-streams/image-streams-rhel7.json
# oc create -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/db-templates

# oc replace -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/db-templates
# oc replace -n openshift -f /usr/share/openshift/examples/quickstart-templates
----
====
endif::[]

[[importing-the-latest-images]]

== Importing the Latest Images
After link:#updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates[updating the
default image streams], you may also want to ensure that the images within those
streams are updated. For each image stream in the default *openshift* project,
you can run:

----
# oc import-image -n openshift <imagestream>
----

For example, get the list of all image streams in the default *openshift*
project:

====
----
# oc get is -n openshift

[[additional-instructions-per-release]]

== Additional Instructions per Release

Some OpenShift releases may have additional instructions specific to that
release that must be performed to fully apply the updates across the cluster.
Read through the following sections carefully depending on your upgrade path, as
you may be required to perform certain steps and key points during the standard
upgrade process described earlier in this topic.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub  to
review the latest release notes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
See the link:../whats_new/ose_3_0_release_notes.html[OpenShift Enterprise 3.0
Release Notes] to review the latest release notes.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[openshift-enterprise-3-0-1-0]]

=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.1.0

The following steps are required for the
link:../whats_new/ose_3_0_release_notes.html#ose-3-0-1-0[OpenShift Enterprise
3.0.1.0 release].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]

=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].
endif::[]

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
link:manage_scc.html[security context constraint] (SCC). Additionally,
'down-then-up' rolling upgrades have been added and is now the preferred
strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ..
    spec:
      ..
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
====
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[openshift-enterprise-3-0-2-0]]

=== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.2.0

The following steps are required for the
link:../whats_new/ose_3_0_release_notes.html#ose-3-0-2-0[OpenShift Enterprise
3.0.2.0 release].
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]

=== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].
endif::[]

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
link:install/deploy_router.html#using-the-container-network-stack[using the
container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ..
  template:
    ..
    spec:
      ..
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

* Configure SDN serviceNetworkCIDR*
Add the `serviceNetworkCIDR` to your master's `networkConfig` section located
in /etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml. This value should match the
`servicesSubnet` value in the `kubernetesMasterConfig` section.

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====
