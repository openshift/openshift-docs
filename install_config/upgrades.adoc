== Overview
When new versions of OpenShift are released, you can upgrade your existing
cluster to apply the latest enhancements and bug fixes.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
For OpenShift Origin, see the
link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] on GitHub  to
review the latest changes.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This includes upgrading from previous minor versions, such as release 3.0 to
3.1, as well as applying asynchronous updates within a minor version, such as
future 3.1.z releases. See the
link:../release_notes/ose_3_1_release_notes.html[OpenShift Enterprise 3.1
Release Notes] to review the latest changes.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the core architectural changes between the major versions, OpenShift
Enterprise 2 environments cannot be upgraded to OpenShift Enterprise 3 and
require a fresh installation.
====
endif::[]

Unless noted otherwise, node and masters within a major version are forward and
backward compatible, so upgrading your cluster should go smoothly. However, you
should not run mismatched versions longer than necessary to upgrade the entire
cluster.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the link:install/quick_install.html[quick] or
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] and the
*_~/.config/installer.cfg.yml_* or inventory file that was used is available,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Starting with Origin 1.0.6, if you installed using the
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] and the inventory file
that was used is available,
endif::[]
you can link:#upgrade-playbook[use an automated upgrade process]. Alternatively,
you can link:#manual-upgrades[upgrade OpenShift manually].

[NOTE]
====
This topic pertains to RPM-based installations only
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
(i.e., the link:install/quick_install.html[quick] and
link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] methods)
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
(i.e., the link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced installation] method)

[[upgrade-playbook]]
== Using the Automated Upgrade
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Starting with OpenShift 3.0.2,
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Starting with Origin 1.0.6,
endif::[]
if you installed using the link:install/advanced_install.html[advanced
installation] and the inventory file that was used is available, you can use the
upgrade playbook to automate the upgrade process.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed using the link:install/quick_install.html[quick installation]
method and a *_~/.config/installer.cfg.yml_* file is avaialble, you can use the
installation utility to perform the automated upgrade.
endif::[]

The automated upgrade performs the following steps for you:

* Applies the latest configuration by re-running the installation playbook.
* Upgrades and restart master services.
* Upgrades and restart node services.
* Applies the latest cluster policies.
* Updates the default router if one exists.
* Updates the default registry if one exists.
* Updates default image streams and InstantApp templates.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The automated upgrade re-runs cluster configuration steps, therefore any
settings that are not stored in your inventory file will be overwritten. The
upgrade process creates a backup of any files that are changed, and you should
carefully review the differences after the upgrade finishes to ensure that your
environment is configured as expected.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Ensure that you have the latest *openshift-ansible* code checked out, then run
the playbook utilizing the default *ansible-hosts* file located in
*_/etc/ansible/hosts_*. If your inventory file is located somewhere else, add
the `-i` flag to specify the location:

----
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
# git pull https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible master
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] playbooks/adhoc/upgrades/upgrade.yml
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
[[preparing-for-an-automated-upgrade]]
=== Preparing for an Automated Upgrade

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, on each master and
node host you must manually disable the 3.0 channel and enable the 3.1 channel:

====
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
====

For any upgrade path, always ensure that you have the latest version of the
*atomic-openshift-utils* package, which should also update the
*openshift-ansible-** packages:

----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

There are two methods for running the automated upgrade:
link:#upgrading-using-the-installation-utility[Using the Installation Utility]
and link:#upgrading-using-ansible-directly[Using Ansible Directly]. Choose and
follow one method, then continue to link:#verifying-the-upgrade[Verifying the
Upgrade].

[[upgrading-using-the-installation-utility]]
=== Using the Installation Utility

If you installed using the link:install/quick_install.html[quick installation]
method, you should have an installation configuration file located at
*_~/.config/installer.cfg.yml_*. The installation utility requires this file to
start an upgrade.

If you have an older format installation configuration file in
*_~/.config/installer.cfg.yml_* from an existing OpenShift Enterprise 3.0
installation, the installation utility will attempt to upgrade the file to the
new supported format. If you do not have an installation configuration file of
any format, you can
link:install/quick_install.html#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[create
one manually].

To start the upgrade, run the installation utility with the `upgrade`
subcommand:

----
# atomic-openshift-installer upgrade
----

Then, follow the on-screen instructions to upgrade to the latest release. After
the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all hosts.

[[upgrading-using-ansible-directly]]
=== Using Ansible Directly

Alternatively, you can run the upgrade playbook directly, similar to the
advanced installation method, if you have an inventory file. For OpenShift
Enterprise 3.1, the only upgrade playbook currently available is for upgrading
from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.

Before running the upgrade, first update your inventory file to change the
`*deployment_type*` parameter from *enterprise* to *openshift-enterprise*; this
is required when upgrading from release 3.0 to 3.1:

----
# sed -i s/deployment_type=enterprise/deployment_type=openshift-enterprise/ </path/to/inventory/file>
----

Then, run the upgrade playbook. If your inventory file is located somewhere
other than the default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, add the `-i` flag to specify the
location.

----
# ansible-playbook [-i </path/to/inventory/file>] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/upgrades/v3_0_to_v3_1/upgrade.yml
----

After the upgrade finishes, a recommendation will be printed to reboot all
hosts.
endif::[]

[[verifying-the-upgrade]]
=== Verifying the Upgrade

To verify the upgrade, first check that all nodes are marked as *Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                 LABELS                                                                STATUS
master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready
node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
----
====

Then, verify that you are running the expected versions of the *docker-registry*
and *router* images, if deployed:

====
----
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.0.4",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.0.4",
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# oc get -n default dc/docker-registry -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.6",
# oc get -n default dc/router -o json | grep \"image\"
    "image": "openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6",
endif::[]
----
====

After upgrading, you can use the experimental diagnostics tool to look for
common issues:

====
----
# openshift ex diagnostics
...
[Note] Summary of diagnostics execution:
[Note] Completed with no errors or warnings seen.
----
====

[[manual-upgrades]]
== Upgrading Manually

As an alternative to using the link:#upgrade-playbook[automated upgrade], you
can manually upgrade your OpenShift cluster. To manually upgrade without
disruption, it is important to upgrade each component as documented in this
topic.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you begin your upgrade, familiarize yourself with the entire procedure.
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Specific releases may require
additional steps] to be performed at key points during the standard upgrade
process.
====

[[preparing-for-a-manual-upgrade]]
=== Preparing for a Manual Upgrade

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, on each master and
node host you must manually disable the 3.0 channel and enable the 3.1 channel:

====
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.1-rpms"
----
====

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, you must also create
an *etcd* backup on each master:

----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/openshift/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----

If you are already running OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 or later, create an *etcd*
backup by running:

----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Create an *etcd* backup on each master:

----
# yum install etcd
# etcdctl backup --data-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd \
    --backup-dir /var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd.bak
----
endif::[]

Ensure that you are running the latest kernel:

----
# yum update kernel
----

[[upgrading-masters]]
=== Upgrading Masters
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the *origin-master*
package:

----
# yum upgrade origin-master
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1:

. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
====
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
====
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----
====

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable origin-master
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-master* service and review its
logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart origin-master
# journalctl -r -u origin-master
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Upgrade your masters first. On each master host, upgrade the
*atomic-openshift-master* package:

----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift-master
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1:

. Create the following master proxy client certificates:
+
====
----
# cd /etc/origin/master/
# oadm ca create-master-certs --cert-dir=/etc/origin/master/ \
            --master=https://<internal-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --public-master=https://<external-master-fqdn>:8443 \
            --hostnames=<external-master-fqdn>,<internal-master-fqdn>,localhost,127.0.0.1,<master-ip-address>,kubernetes.default.local \
            --overwrite=false
----
====
+
This creates files at  *_/etc/origin/master/master.proxy-client.{crt,key}_*.

. Then, add the master proxy client certificates to the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master:
+
====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  proxyClientInfo:
    certFile: master.proxy-client.crt
    keyFile: master.proxy-client.key
----
====

. Enable the following renamed service on master hosts:
+
----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-master
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-master* service and
review its logs to ensure services have been restarted successfully:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
# journalctl -r -u atomic-openshift-master
----
endif::[]

[[updating-policy-definitions]]
=== Updating Policy Definitions

After a cluster upgrade, the recommended
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[default
cluster roles] may have been updated. To check if an update is recommended for
your environment, you can run:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
----

This command outputs a list of roles that are out of date and their new proposed
values. For example:

====
----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: v1
  kind: ClusterRole
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: admin
  rules:
  - attributeRestrictions: null
    resources:
    - builds/custom
...
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Your output will vary based on the OpenShift version and any local
customizations you have made. Review the proposed policy carefully.
====

You can either modify this output to re-apply any local policy changes you have
made, or you can automatically apply the new policy by running:

----
# oadm policy reconcile-cluster-roles --confirm
----

[[upgrading-nodes]]
=== Upgrading Nodes

After upgrading your masters, you can upgrade your nodes. When restarting the
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
*origin-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*atomic-openshift-node* service, there will be a brief disruption of outbound network
endif::[]
connectivity from running pods to services while the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#service-proxy[service
proxy] is restarted. The length of this disruption should be very short and
scales based on the number of services in the entire cluster.

For each node that is not also a master, disable scheduling before you upgrade
them:

====
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=false
----
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
On each node host, upgrade all *origin* packages:

----
# yum upgrade origin\*
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Origin 1.0 to 1.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:

----
# systemctl enable origin-node
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *origin-node* service:

----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
On each node host, upgrade all *atomic-openshift* packages:

----
# yum upgrade atomic-openshift\*
----

If you are upgrading from OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 to 3.1, enable the following
renamed service on node hosts:

----
# systemctl enable atomic-openshift-node
----

For any upgrade path, now restart the *atomic-openshift-node* service:

----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]

Enable scheduling again for any non-master nodes that you disabled:

====
----
# oadm manage-node <node> --schedulable=true
----
====

As a user with *cluster-admin* privileges, verify that all nodes are showing as
*Ready*:

====
----
# oc get nodes
NAME                    LABELS                                        STATUS
master.example.com      kubernetes.io/hostname=master.example.com     Ready,SchedulingDisabled
node1.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node1.example.com      Ready
node2.example.com       kubernetes.io/hostname=node2.example.com      Ready
----
====

[[upgrading-the-router]]
=== Upgrading the Router

If you have previously
link:../install_config/install/deploy_router.html[deployed a router], the router
deployment configuration must be upgraded to apply updates contained in the
router image. To upgrade your router without disrupting services, you must have
previously deployed a
link:../admin_guide/high_availability.html#configuring-a-highly-available-routing-service[highly-available
routing service].

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading to OpenShift Origin 1.0.4 or 1.0.5, first see the
link:#additional-instructions-per-release[Additional Manual Instructions per
Release] section for important steps specific to your upgrade, then continue
with the router upgrade as described in this section.
====
endif::[]

Edit your router's deployment configuration. For example, if it has the default
*router* name:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-haproxy-router:v3.1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-haproxy-router:v1.0.6 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

You should see one router pod updated and then the next.

[[upgrading-the-registry]]
=== Upgrading the Registry

The registry must also be upgraded for changes to take effect in the registry
image. If you have used a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` or a host mount point, you
may restart the registry without losing the contents of your registry. The
link:install/docker_registry.html#storage-for-the-registry[registry
installation] topic details how to configure persistent storage.

Edit your registry's deployment configuration:

----
# oc edit dc/docker-registry
----

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
 template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        ...
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
        image: registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
        image: openshift/origin-docker-registry:v1.0.4 <1>
endif::[]
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ...
----
====
<1> Adjust the image version to match the version you are upgrading to.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Images that are being pushed or pulled from the internal registry at the time of
upgrade will fail and should be restarted automatically. This will not disrupt
pods that are already running.
====

[[updating-the-default-image-streams-and-templates]]
=== Updating the Default Image Streams and Templates

By default, the
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

default image streams, InstantApp templates, and database service templates in
the *openshift* project, which is a default project to which all users have view
access. These objects were created during installation from the JSON files
located under *_/usr/share/openshift/examples_*. Running the latest installer
will copy newer files into place, but it does not currently update the
*openshift* project.

You can update the global *openshift* project by running the following commands.
It is expected that you will receive warnings about items that already exist.

endif::[]

*Removing Support for the v1beta3 API*

Update the *_/etc/openshift/master/master-config.yml_* file on each master, and
remove *v1beta3* from the `*apiLevels*` and `*kubernetesMasterConfig.apiLevels*`
parameters.

*Creating Symlinks for New Directories*

Some directories were renamed from *openshift* to *origin*, so create the
following symlinks:

----
# ln -s /var/lib/openshift /var/lib/origin
# ln -s /etc/openshift /etc/origin
----

[[openshift-origin-1-0-4]]
==== OpenShift Origin 1.0.4

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases/tag/v1.0.4[OpenShift Origin 1.0.4
release].

*Creating a Service Account for the Router*

The default HAProxy router was updated to utilize host ports and requires that a
service account be created and made a member of the privileged
link:../admin_guide/manage_scc.html[security context constraint] (SCC).
Additionally, "down-then-up" rolling upgrades have been added and is now the
preferred strategy for upgrading routers.

After upgrading your master and nodes but before updating to the newer router,
you must create a service account for the router. As a cluster administrator,
ensure you are operating on the *default* project:

====
----
# oc project default
----
====

Delete any existing *router* service account and create a new one:

====
----
# oc delete serviceaccount/router
serviceaccounts/router

# echo '{"kind":"ServiceAccount","apiVersion":"v1","metadata":{"name":"router"}}' | oc create -f -
serviceaccounts/router
----
====

Edit the *privileged* SCC:

====
----
# oc edit scc privileged
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowHostNetwork: true <1>
allowHostPorts: true <2>
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
...
users:
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
- system:serviceaccount:default:router <3>
----
<1> Add or update `allowHostNetwork: true`.
<2> Add or update `allowHostPorts: true`.
<3> Add the service account you created to the `*users*` list at the end of the
file.
====

Edit your router's deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
  strategy:
    resources: {}
    rollingParams:
      intervalSeconds: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 120
      updatePeriodSeconds: 1
      updatePercent: -10 <1>
    type: Rolling
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      restartPolicy: Always
      serviceAccount: router <2>
      serviceAccountName: router <3>
...
----
====
<1> Add `updatePercent: -10` to allow down-then-up rolling upgrades.
<2> Add `serviceAccount: router` to the template `*spec*`.
<3> Add `serviceAccountName: router` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

[[openshift-origin-1-0-5]]
==== OpenShift Origin 1.0.5

The following steps are required for the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin 1.0.5
release].

*Switching the Router to Use the Host Network Stack*

The default HAProxy router was updated to use the host networking stack by
default instead of the former behavior of
link:install/deploy_router.html#using-the-container-network-stack[using the
container network stack], which proxied traffic to the router, which in turn
proxied the traffic to the target service and container. This new default
behavior benefits performance because network traffic from remote clients no
longer needs to take multiple hops through user space in order to reach the
target service and container.

Additionally, the new default behavior enables the router to get the actual
source IP address of the remote connection. This is useful for defining
ingress rules based on the originating IP, supporting sticky sessions, and
monitoring traffic, among other uses.

Existing router deployments will continue to use the container network stack
unless modified to switch to using the host network stack.

To switch the router to use the host network stack, edit your router's
deployment configuration:

====
----
# oc edit dc/router
----
====

Apply the following changes:

====
----
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    router: router
    ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80 <1>
          hostPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 443 <1>
          hostPort: 443
          protocol: TCP
        - containerPort: 1936 <1>
          hostPort: 1936
          name: stats
          protocol: TCP
        resources: {}
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
      dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
      hostNetwork: true <2>
      restartPolicy: Always
...
----
====
<1> For host networking, ensure that the `*containerPort*` value matches the
`*hostPort*` values for each of the ports.
<2> Add `*hostNetwork: true*` to the template `*spec*`.

Now upgrade your router per the link:#upgrading-the-router[standard router
upgrade steps].

*Configuring serviceNetworkCIDR for the SDN*

Add the `*serviceNetworkCIDR*` parameter to the `*networkConfig*` section in
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*. This value should match the
`*servicesSubnet*` value in the `*kubernetesMasterConfig*` section:

====
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  servicesSubnet: 172.30.0.0/16
...
networkConfig:
  serviceNetworkCIDR: 172.30.0.0/16
----
====

*Adding the Scheduler Configuration API Version*

The scheduler configuration file incorrectly lacked `*kind*` and `*apiVersion*`
fields when deployed using the quick or advanced installation methods. This will
affect future upgrades, so it is important to add those values if they do not
exist.

Modify the *_/etc/origin/master/scheduler.json_* file to add the `*kind*` and
`*apiVersion*` fields:

====
----
{
  "kind": "Policy", <1>
  "apiVersion": "v1", <2>
  "predicates": [
  ...
}
----
====
<1> Add `*"kind": "Policy",*`
<2> Add `*"apiVersion": "v1",*`
