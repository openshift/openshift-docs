After installing {product-title} and
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[deploying
a router], you can configure the default timeouts for an existing route when you
have services in need of a low timeout, as required for Service Level
Availability (SLA) purposes, or a high timeout, for cases with a slow back end.
If undefined, the default route timeout is defined by ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT
(see xref:../architecture/networking/routes.html#env-variables)

Using the `oc annotate` command, add the timeout to the route:

====
----
# oc annotate route <route_name> \
    --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=<timeout><time_unit>
----
====

For example, to set a route named `myroute` to a timeout of two seconds:

====
----
# oc annotate route myroute --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=2s
----
====

Supported time units are microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s),
minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d).
