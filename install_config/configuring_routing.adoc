== Overview
After installing {product-title} and
xref:../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[deploying a router], you can
modify the router to suit your needs using the examples in this topic.

[[install-config-configuring-route-timeouts]]
== Configuring Route Timeouts
You can configure the default timeouts for an existing route when you have
services in need of a low timeout, as required for Service Level Availability
(SLA) purposes, or a high timeout, for cases with a slow back end.

Using the `oc annotate` command, add the timeout to the route:

====
----
# oc annotate route <route_name> \
    --overwrite haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout=<timeout><time_unit>
----
====

For example, to set a route named `myroute` to a timeout of two seconds:

====
----
# oc annotate route myroute --overwrite haproxy.router.opensfhit.io/timeout=2s
----
====

Supported time units are microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s),
minutes (m), hours (h), or days (d).

== Configuring Native Container Routing
This section describes how to set up container networking using existing
switches and routers and the kernel networking stack in Linux. The setup
requires that the network administrator or a script modifies the router or
routers when new nodes are added to the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure outlined in this topic can be adapted to any type of router.

[[install-config-network-overview]]
=== Network Overview
The following describes a general network setup:

* 11.11.0.0/16 is the container network.
* The 11.11.x.0/24 subnet is reserved for each node and assigned to the Docker Linux bridge.
* Each node has a route to the router for reaching anything in the 11.11.0.0/16 range, except the local subnet.
* The router has routes for each node, so it can be directed to the right node.
* Existing nodes do not need any changes when new nodes are added, unless the network topology is modified.
* IP forwarding is enabled on each node.

The following diagram shows the container networking setup described in this
topic. It uses one Linux node with two network interface cards serving as a
router, two switches, and three nodes connected to these switches.

Node setup::

. Assign an unused 11.11.x.0/24 subnet IP address to the Linux bridge on the node:
+
----
# brctl addbr lbr0
# ip addr add 11.11.1.1/24 dev lbr0
# ip link set dev lbr0 up
----

. Modify the Docker startup script to use the new bridge. By default, the
startup script is the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file:
+
----
# docker -d -b lbr0 --other-options
----

. Add a route to the router for the 11.11.0.0/16 network:
+
----
# ip route add 11.11.0.0/16 via 192.168.2.2 dev p3p1
----

. Enable IP forwarding on the node:
+
----
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

Router setup::

The following procedure assumes a Linux box with multiple NICs is used as a
router. Modify the steps as required to use the syntax for a particular router:

. Enable IP forwarding on the router:
+
----
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

. Add a route for each node added to the cluster:
+
----
# ip route add <node_subnet> via <node_ip_address> dev <interface through which node is L2 accessible>
# ip route add 11.11.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1 dev p3p1
# ip route add 11.11.2.0/24 via 192.168.3.3 dev p3p2
# ip route add 11.11.3.0/24 via 192.168.3.4 dev p3p2
