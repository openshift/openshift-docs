== Overview
As an {product-title} administrator, you can use groups to manage users, change
their permissions, and enhance collaboration. Your organization may have already
created user groups and stored them in an LDAP server. {product-title} can sync
those LDAP records with internal {product-title} records, enabling you to manage
your groups in one place. {product-title} currently supports group sync with
LDAP servers using three common schemas for defining group membership: RFC 2307,
Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory.

[NOTE]
====
You must have
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[`cluster-admin`
privileges] to sync groups.
====

[[configuring-ldap-sync]]
== Configuring LDAP Sync

Before you can xref:running-ldap-sync[run LDAP sync], you need a sync
configuration file. This file contains LDAP client configuration details:

* Configuration for connecting to your LDAP server.
* Sync configuration options that are dependent on the schema used in your LDAP
server.

A sync configuration file can also contain an administrator-defined list of name
mappings that maps {product-title} Group names to groups in your LDAP server.

[[ldap-client-configuration]]
=== LDAP Client Configuration

.LDAP Client Configuration
====
[source,yaml]
----
url: ldap://10.0.0.0:389 <1>
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com <2>
bindPassword: password <3>
insecure: false <4>
ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt <5>
----
<1> The connection protocol, IP address of the LDAP server hosting your
database, and the port to connect to, formatted as `scheme://host:port`.
<2> Optional distinguished name (DN) to use as the Bind DN.
{product-title} uses this if elevated privilege is required to retrieve entries for
the sync operation.
<3> Optional password to use to bind. {product-title} uses this if elevated privilege is
necessary to retrieve entries for the sync operation. This value may also be
provided in an
xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration.adoc#master-node-configuration-passwords-and-other-data[environment
variable, external file, or encrypted file].
<4> When `true`, no TLS connection is made to the server. When `false`, secure
LDAP (`ldaps://`) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (`ldap://`) URLs are
upgraded to TLS.
<5> The certificate bundle to use for validating server certificates for the
configured URL. If empty, {product-title} uses system-trusted roots. This only applies
if `insecure` is set to `false`.
====

[[ldap-query-definition]]
=== LDAP Query Definition

Sync configurations consist of LDAP query definitions for the entries that are
required for synchronization. The specific definition of an LDAP query depends
on the schema used to store membership information in the LDAP server.

.LDAP Query Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
baseDN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com <1>
scope: sub <2>
derefAliases: never <3>
timeout: 0 <4>
filter: (objectClass=inetOrgPerson) <5>
pageSize: 0 <6>
----
<1> The distinguished name (DN) of the branch of the directory where all
searches will start from. It is required that you specify the top of your
directory tree, but you can also specify a subtree in the directory.
<2> The scope of the search. Valid values are `base`, `one`, or `sub`. If this
is left undefined, then a scope of `sub` is assumed. Descriptions of the scope
options can be found in the xref:ldap-search[table below].
<3> The behavior of the search with respect to aliases in the LDAP tree. Valid
values are `never`, `search`, `base`, or `always`. If this is left undefined,
then the default is to `always` dereference aliases. Descriptions of the
dereferencing behaviors can be found in the xref:deref-aliases[table below].
<4> The time limit allowed for the search by the client, in seconds. A value of
0 imposes no client-side limit.
<5> A valid LDAP search filter. If this is left undefined, then the default is
`(objectClass=*)`.
<6> The optional maximum size of response pages from the server, measured in LDAP
entries. If set to 0, no size restrictions will be made on pages of responses.
Setting paging sizes is necessary when queries return more entries than the
client or server allow by default.
====

[[ldap-search]]
.LDAP Search Scope Options
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|LDAP Search Scope | Description
.^|`base`          | Only consider the object specified by the base DN given for the query.
.^|`one`           | Consider all of the objects on the same level in the tree as the base DN for
the query.
.^|`sub`           | Consider the entire subtree rooted at the base DN given for the query.
|===

[[deref-aliases]]
.LDAP Dereferencing Behaviors
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Dereferencing Behavior | Description
.^|`never`              | Never dereference any aliases found in the LDAP tree.
.^|`search`             | Only dereference aliases found while searching.
.^|`base`               | Only dereference aliases while finding the base object.
.^|`always`             | Always dereference all aliases found in the LDAP tree.
|===

[[user-defined-name-mapping]]
=== User-Defined Name Mapping

A user-defined name mapping explicitly maps the names of {product-title} Groups to
unique identifiers that find groups on your LDAP server. The mapping uses normal
YAML syntax. A user-defined mapping can contain an entry for every group in your
LDAP server or only a subset of those groups. If there are groups on the LDAP
server that do not have a user-defined name mapping, the default behavior during
sync is to use the attribute specified as the Group's name.

.User-Defined Name Mapping
====
[source,yaml]
----
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": firstgroup
  "cn=group2,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": secondgroup
  "cn=group3,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": thirdgroup
----

[[running-ldap-sync]]
== Running LDAP Sync

Once you have created a xref:configuring-ldap-sync[sync configuration file],
then sync can begin. {product-title} allows administrators to perform a number of
different sync types with the same server.

[NOTE]
====
By default, all group synchronization or pruning operations are dry-run, so you
must set the `--confirm` flag on the `oc adm groups sync` command in order to make
changes to {product-title} group records.
====

To sync all groups from the LDAP server with {product-title}:

----
$ oc adm groups sync --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

To sync all Groups already in {product-title} that correspond to groups in the
LDAP server specified in the configuration file:

----
$ oc adm groups sync --type=openshift --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

To sync a subset of LDAP groups with {product-title}, you can use whitelist files,
blacklist files, or both:

[NOTE]
====
Any combination of blacklist files, whitelist files, or whitelist literals will
work; whitelist literals can be included directly in the command itself. This
applies to groups found on LDAP servers, as well as Groups already present in
{product-title}. Your files must contain one unique group identifier per line.
====

----
$ oc adm groups sync --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
$ oc adm groups sync --blacklist=<blacklist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
$ oc adm groups sync <group_unique_identifier>    \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
$ oc adm groups sync <group_unique_identifier>    \
                   --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --blacklist=<blacklist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
$ oc adm groups sync --type=openshift             \
                   --whitelist=<whitelist_file> \
                   --sync-config=config.yaml    \
                   --confirm
----

[[running-a-group-pruning-job]]
== Running a Group Pruning Job

An administrator can also choose to remove groups from {product-title} records
if the records on the LDAP server that created them are no longer present. The
prune job will accept the same sync configuration file and white- or black-lists
as used for the sync job. More information is available in
xref:../admin_guide/pruning_resources.adoc#pruning-groups[Pruning groups] section.

[[sync-examples]]
== Sync Examples

This section contains examples for the xref:sync-ldap-rfc-2307[RFC 2307],
xref:sync-ldap-active-directory[Active Directory], and
xref:sync-ldap-augmented-active-directory[augmented Active Directory] schemas.
All of the following examples synchronize a group named `admins` that has two
members: `Jane` and `Jim`. Each example explains:

* How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.
* What the LDAP sync configuration file looks like.
* What the resulting Group record in {product-title} will be after synchronization.

[NOTE]
====
These examples assume that all users are direct members of their respective
groups. Specifically, no groups have other groups as members. See
xref:sync-ldap-nested-example[Nested Membership Sync Example] for information on
how to sync nested groups.
====

[[sync-ldap-rfc-2307]]
=== RFC 2307

In the RFC 2307 schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups exist on the LDAP
server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on
the group. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and group for this
schema:

----
<1> The group is a first-class entry in the LDAP server.
<2> Members of a group are listed with an identifying reference as attributes on
the group.
====

To sync this group, you must first create the configuration file. The
RFC 2307 schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for both user
and group entries, as well as the attributes with which to represent them in the
internal {product-title} records.

For clarity, the Group you create in {product-title} should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a Group by their e-mail, and use the
name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates
these relationships:

[NOTE]
====
If using user-defined name mappings, your
xref:rfc2307-with-user-defined-name-mappings[configuration file] will differ.

[[rfc2307-with-error-tolerances]]
=== RFC 2307 with User-Defined Error Tolerances

By default, if the groups being synced contain members whose entries are outside
of the scope defined in the member query, the group sync fails with an error:

----
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with dn="<user-dn>" would search outside of the base dn specified (dn="<base-dn>")".
----

This often indicates a mis-configured `baseDN` in the `usersQuery` field.
However, in cases where the `baseDN` intentionally does not contain some of the
members of the group, setting `tolerateMemberOutOfScopeErrors: true` allows
the group sync to continue. Out of scope members will be ignored.

Similarly, when the group sync process fails to locate a member for a group, it
fails outright with errors:

----
Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" refers to a non-existent entry".

Error determining LDAP group membership for "<group>": membership lookup for user "<user>" in group "<group>" failed because of "search for entry with base dn="<user-dn>" and filter "<filter>" did not return any results".
----

This often indicates a mis-configured `usersQuery` field. However, in cases
where the group contains member entries that are known to be missing, setting
`tolerateMemberNotFoundErrors: true` allows the group sync to continue.
Problematic members will be ignored.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling error tolerances for the LDAP group sync causes the sync process to
ignore problematic member entries. If the LDAP group sync is not configured
correctly, this could result in synced {product-title} groups missing members.

To sync this group, you must first create the configuration file. The
Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for
user entries, as well as the attributes to represent them with in the internal
{product-title} Group records.

For clarity, the Group you create in {product-title} should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a Group by their e-mail, but define
the name of the Group by the name of the group on the LDAP server.

=== Augmented Active Directory

In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups
exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored
in attributes on the user. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and
group for this schema:

To sync this group, you must first create the configuration file. The
augmented Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query
definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes
with which to represent them in the internal {product-title} Group records.

For clarity, the Group you create in {product-title} should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a Group by their e-mail,
and use the name of the Group as the common name. The following configuration
file creates these relationships.

[[sync-ldap-nested-example]]
== Nested Membership Sync Example

Groups in {product-title} do not nest. The LDAP server must flatten group
membership before the data can be consumed. Microsoft's Active Directory Server
supports this feature via the
link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx[`LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`]
rule, which has the OID `1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941`. Furthermore, only explicitly
xref:../install_config/syncing_groups_with_ldap.adoc#running-ldap-sync[whitelisted]
groups can be synced when using this matching rule.

This section has an example for the augmented Active Directory schema, which
synchronizes a group named `admins` that has one user `Jane` and one group
`otheradmins` as members. The `otheradmins` group has one user member: `Jim`.
This example explains:

* How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.
* What the LDAP sync configuration file looks like.
* What the resulting Group record in {product-title} will be after synchronization.

In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (`Jane` and `Jim`) and
groups exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is
stored in attributes on the user or the group. The following snippet of `ldif`
defines the users and groups for this schema:

<1> The user's and group's memberships are listed as attributes on the object.
<2> The groups are first-class entries on the LDAP server.
<3> The `otheradmins` group is a member of the `admins` group.

To sync nested groups with Active Directory, you must provide an LDAP query
definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes
with which to represent them in the internal {product-title} Group records.
Furthermore, certain changes are required in this configuration:

- The `oc adm groups sync` command must explicitly
xref:../install_config/syncing_groups_with_ldap.adoc#running-ldap-sync[whitelist]
groups.
- The user's `groupMembershipAttributes` must include
`"memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:"` to comply with the
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx[`LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN`]
rule.
- The `groupUIDAttribute` must be set to `dn`.
- The `groupsQuery`:
  * Must not set `filter`.
  * Must set a valid `derefAliases`.
  * Should not set `baseDN` as that value is ignored.
  * Should not set `scope` as that value is ignored.

For clarity, the Group you create in {product-title} should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a Group by their e-mail, and use the
name of the Group as the common name. The following configuration file creates
these relationships:

[[sync-ldap-configuration]]
== LDAP Sync Configuration Specification

The object specification for the configuration file is below.  Note that the different schema
objects have different fields.  For example, xref:sync-ldap-v1-activedirectoryconfig[v1.ActiveDirectoryConfig] has no `groupsQuery`
field whereas xref:sync-ldap-v1-rfc2307config[v1.RFC2307Config] and xref:sync-ldap-v1-augmentedactivedirectoryconfig[v1.AugmentedActiveDirectoryConfig] both do.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is no support for binary attributes. All attribute data coming from the
LDAP server must be in the format of a UTF-8 encoded string. For example, never
use a binary attribute, such as `objectGUID`, as an ID attribute. You must use
string attributes, such as `sAMAccountName` or `userPrincipalName`, instead.
