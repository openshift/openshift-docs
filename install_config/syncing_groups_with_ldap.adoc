== Overview
As an OpenShift administrator, grouping users allows you to better manage them,
change their permissions, or to enhance collaboration. Your organization may
have already created user groups and stored them in an LDAP server. OpenShift
can sync those LDAP records with internal OpenShift records, allowing you
to simply manage your groups in one place. OpenShift currently supports group
sync with LDAP servers using three common schemas for defining group
membership: RFC 2307, Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory.

[NOTE]
====
You must have
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin* privileges] to sync groups.

== Configuring LDAP Sync

Before you can
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#running-ldap-synchronization[run LDAP sync], you need a sync configuration
file. This file contains LDAP client configuration details, allowing you to:

* Correctly connect to your LDAP server.
* Sync configuration options that are dependent on the schema used in your LDAP server.

A sync configuration file can also contain an administrator-defined list of name
mappings, which is useful when deciding which groups in OpenShift to map to the
groups in your LDAP server.

=== LDAP Client Configuration

.LDAP Client Configuration
====
[source,yaml]
----
url: ldap://10.0.0.0:389 <1>
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com <2>
bindPassword: password <3>
insecure: true <4>
ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt <5>
----
<1> The connection protocol, IP address of the LDAP server hosting your
database, and the port to connect to, formatted as `scheme://host:port`.
<2> Optionally, specify a distinguished name (DN) to use as the Bind DN.
OpenShift uses this if elevated privilege is required to retrieve entries for
the sync operation.
<3> Optionally, specify a password to use to bind. OpenShift uses this if
elevated privilege is necessary to retrieve entries for the sync
operation.
<4> When `true`, no TLS connection is made to the server. When `false`, secure
LDAP (`ldaps://`) URLs connect using TLS, and insecure LDAP (`ldap://`) URLs are
upgraded to TLS.
<5> The certificate bundle to use for validating server certificates for the
configured URL. If empty, OpenShift uses system-trusted roots. This only applies
if `insecure` is set to `false`.
====

=== LDAP Query Definition
Sync configurations consist of LDAP query definitions for the entries that are
required for synchronization. The specific definition of an LDAP query depends
on the schema used to store membership information in the LDAP server.

.LDAP Query Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
baseDN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com <1>
scope: sub <2>
derefAliases: never <3>
timeout: 0 <4>
filter: (objectClass=intOrgPerson) <5>
----
<1> The distinguished name (DN) of the branch of the directory where all
searches will start from. It is required that you specify the top of your
directory tree, but you can also specify a subtree in the directory.
<2> The scope of the search. Valid values are `base`, `one`, or `sub`. If this
is left undefined, then a scope of `sub` is assumed. Descriptions of the scope
options can be found in the
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#ldap-search[table below].
<3> The behavior of the search with respect to aliases in the LDAP tree. Valid
values are `never`, `search`, `base`, or `always`. If this is left undefined,
then the default is to `always` dereference aliases. Descriptions of the
dereferencing behaviors can be found in the
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#deref-aliases[table below].
<4> The time limit allowed for the search by the client, in seconds. A value of
0 imposes no client-side limit.
<5> A valid LDAP search filter. If this is left undefined, then the default is
`(objectClass=*)`.
====

[[ldap-search]]
.LDAP Search Scope Options
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|LDAP Search Scope | Description
.^|`base`          | Only consider the object at specified by the base DN given for the query.
.^|`one`           | Consider all of the objects on the same level in the tree as the base DN for
the query.
.^|`sub`           | Consider the entire subtree rooted at the base DN given for the query.
|===

[[deref-aliases]]
.LDAP Dereferencing Behaviors
[cols="2a,8a",options="header"]
|===
|Dereferencing Behavior | Description
.^|`never`              | Never dereference any aliases found in the LDAP tree.
.^|`search`             | Only dereference aliases found while searching.
.^|`base`               | Only dereference aliases while finding the base object.
.^|`always`             | Always dereference all aliases found in the LDAP tree.
|===

=== User-Defined Name Mapping
A user-defined name mapping explicitly maps the names of OpenShift groups to
unique identifiers that find groups on your LDAP server. The mapping uses normal
YAML syntax. A user-defined mapping can contain an entry for every group in your
LDAP server or only a subset of those groups. If there are groups on the LDAP
server that do not have a user-defined name mapping, the default behavior during
sync is to use the attribute specified as the group's name.

.User-Defined Name Mapping
====
[source,yaml]
----
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": firstgroup
  "cn=group2,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": secondgroup
  "cn=group3,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": thirdgroup
----
====

== Running LDAP Sync
Once you've created a
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#configuring-ldap-sync[sync configuration file],
then sync can begin. OpenShift allows administrators to perform a
number of different sync types with the same server.

[NOTE]
====
By default, all group sync operations are dry-run, so you must set
the `--confirm` flag on the `sync-groups` command in order to make changes to
OpenShift Group records.
====

To sync all groups from the LDAP server with OpenShift:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

To sync all groups already in OpenShift that correspond to the LDAP
server specified in the configuration file:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --type=openshift --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

To sync a subset of LDAP groups with OpenShift, you can use whitelist
files, blacklist files, or both:

[NOTE]
====
Any combination of blacklist files, whitelist files, or whitelist literals will
work; whitelist literals can be included directly in the command itself. This
applies to groups found on LDAP servers, as well as groups already present in
OpenShift. Your files must contain one unique group identifier per line.
====

----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --whitelist=whitelist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups --blacklist=blacklist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups group_unique_idenitifer --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups group_unique_idenitifer   \
                           --whitelist=whitelist.txt \
                           --blacklist=blacklist.txt \
                           --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups --type=openshift --whitelist=whitelist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

== Sync Examples
This section contains examples for the link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#rfc-2307[RFC 2307],
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#active-directory[Active Directory],
and link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#augmented-active-directory[Augmented Active Directory] schemas.
All of the following examples synchronize a group named *_admins_* that has two
members: *_Jane_* and *_Jim_*. Each example explains:

* How the group and users are added to the LDAP server.
* What the LDAP sync configuration file looks like.
* What the resulting group record in OpenShift will be after synchronization.

=== RFC 2307
In the RFC 2307 schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups exist on the LDAP
server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on
the group. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and group for this
schema.

.LDAP Entries Using RFC2307 Schema: `rfc2307.ldif`
====
[source,ldif]

----
<1> The group is a first-class entry in the LDAP server.
<2> Members of a group are listed with an identifying reference as attributes on
the group.
====

To sync this group, you must first create the configuration file. The
RFC2307 schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for both user
and group entries, as well as the attributes to represent them with in the
internal OpenShift records.

For clarity, the group you create in OpenShift should use attributes other than
the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a group by their e-mail, and use the
name of the group as the common name. The following configuration file creates
these relationships:

[NOTE]
====
If using user-defined name mappings, your
link:../admin_guide/syncing_groups_with_ldap.html#rfc2307-with-user-defined-name-mappings[configuration file] will differ.

=== Active Directory
In the Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) exist in the LDAP
server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored in attributes on
the user. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and group for this
schema:

.LDAP Entries Using Active Directory Schema: `active_directory.ldif`
====
[source,ldif]
----
dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com

----
<1> The user's group memberships are listed as attributes on the user, and the
group does not exist as an entry on the server. The `testMemberOf` attribute
cannot be a literal attribute on the user; it can be created during search and
returned to the client but not committed to the database.
====

To sync this group, you must first create the configuration file. The
Active Directory schema requires you to provide an LDAP query definition for
user entries, as well as the attributes to represent them with in the internal
OpenShift records.

For clarity, the group you create in OpenShift should use attributes other
than the distinguished name whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing
fields. For example, identify the users of a group by their e-mail, but the
name of the group is defined by the name of the group on the LDAP server.
The following configuration file creates these relationships:

=== Augmented Active Directory
In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users (Jane and Jim) and groups
exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries, and group membership is stored
in attributes on the user. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the users and
group for this schema:
