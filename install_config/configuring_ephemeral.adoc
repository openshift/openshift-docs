== Overview
{product-title} can be configured to allow management of ephemeral
storage of pod and container working data.  While containers
have been able to utilize writable layers, logs directories, and
EmptyDir volumes, this storage has been subject to a number of
limitations,
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/ephemeral-storage.adoc[as
discussed here].

Ephemeral storage management permits administrators to limit the
resources consumed by individual pods and containers, and for pods and
containers to specify requests and limits on their use of such
ephemeral storage.  It is a tech preview new in {product-title} 3.10
and is disabled by default.

Note that this tech preview does not change any of the mechanisms for
making local storage available in {product-title}; the existing
mechanisms (root directory or runtime directory) are still used.  This
preview only provides mechanism for managing the use of this resource.

=== Enable Ephemeral Storage
Enable the `LocalStorageCapacityIsolation` feature gate on all masters and nodes.

The feature gates are enabled/disabled by means of command line
arguments to the kubelet on each node (master as well as node).  These
arguments are passed by means of ConfigMaps in the `openshift-node`
namespace.  You edit these ConfigMaps via the `oc edit` command.  The
config maps to be edited may be found via

```
oc 

. Edit or create the master configuration file on all masters (*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default) and add  `LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true` under the `apiServerArguments` and `controllerArguments` sections:
+
[source, yaml]
----
apiServerArguments:
   feature-gates:
   - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
...

 controllerArguments:
   feature-gates:
   - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
...
----
```

. Edit the ConfigMap for all nodes to enable the LocalStorageCapacityIsolation on the command line.  You can identify the ConfigMaps that need to be edited as follows:

```
$ oc get cm -n openshift-node
NAME                  DATA      AGE
node-config-compute   1         52m
node-config-infra     1         52m
node-config-master    1         52m
```

For each of these maps (node-config-compute, node-config-infra, and
node-config-master), you need to add the featuregate:

```
oc edit cm node-config-master -n openshift-node
```

If there is already a feature-gates: declaration, you need to add

```
,LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
```

to the list of feature gates.  If not, you need to add:

```
  feature-gates:
  - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
```

Repeat for node-config-compute and node-config-infra, and any other
ConfigMaps you may find.

Following this, you will need to restart {product-title} and delete the container running the apiserver.

Omitting any of these steps may result in ephemeral storage management
not being enabled.
