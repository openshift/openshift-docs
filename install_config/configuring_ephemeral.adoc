== Overview
{product-title} can be configured to allow management of ephemeral
storage of pod and container working data.  While containers
have been able to utilize writable layers, logs directories, and
EmptyDir volumes, this storage has been subject to a number of
limitations,
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/ephemeral-storage.adoc[as
discussed here].

Ephemeral storage management permits administrators to limit the
resources consumed by individual pods and containers, and for pods and
containers to specify requests and limits on their use of such
ephemeral storage. This is a technology preview and is disabled by default.

[NOTE]
====
This technology preview does not change any of the mechanisms for making local
storage available in {product-title}; the existing mechanisms, root directory or
runtime directory, still apply. This technology preview only provides a
mechanism for managing the use of this resource.

== Enabling ephemeral storage

To enable ephemeral storage:

. Edit or create the master configuration file on all masters,
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* by default, and add
`LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true` in the `apiServerArguments` and
`controllerArguments` sections:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiServerArguments:
   feature-gates:
   - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
...

 controllerArguments:
   feature-gates:
   - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
...
----

. Edit the ConfigMap for all nodes to enable the LocalStorageCapacityIsolation on the command line. You can identify the ConfigMaps that need to be edited as follows:
+
----
$ oc get cm -n openshift-node
NAME                  DATA      AGE
node-config-compute   1         52m
node-config-infra     1         52m
node-config-master    1         52m
----
+
For each of these maps, `node-config-compute`, `node-config-infra`, and
`node-config-master`, you need to add the feature gate:
+
----
oc edit cm node-config-master -n openshift-node
----
+
If there is already a `feature-gates:` declaration, add the following text to the list of feature gates:
+
----
,LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
----
+
If there is no `feature-gates:` declaration, add the following section:
+
----
  feature-gates:
  - LocalStorageCapacityIsolation=true
----

. Repeat for `node-config-compute`, `node-config-infra`, and any other
ConfigMaps.

. Restart {product-title} and delete the container running the apiserver.

[NOTE]
====
Omitting any of these steps may result in ephemeral storage management
not being enabled.
