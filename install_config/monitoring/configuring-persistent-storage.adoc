= Configuring persistent storage

Running cluster monitoring with persistent storage means that your metrics are stored to a persistent volume and can survive a pod being restarted or recreated. This is ideal if you require your metrics or alerting data to be guarded from data loss. For production environments it is highly recommended to configure persistent storage.
