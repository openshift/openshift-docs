{product-title} Monitoring creates a number of resources. You can misuse these resources in two ways:

. *Modify the resources.* The {product-title} Monitoring stack ensures its resources are _always_ in the state it expects them to be. If they are modified, {product-title} Monitoring stack will reset them.
. *Use the resources for your purposes.* The resources created by the {product-title} Monitoring stack are not meant to be used by any other resources, as there are no guarantees about their backward compatibility.
+
For example, a `ClusterRole` called `prometheus-k8s` is created, and has very specific roles that exist solely for the cluster monitoring Prometheus pods to be able to access the resources it requires access to. All of these resources have no compatibility guarantees going forward. While some of these resources may incidentally have the necessary information for RBAC purposes for example, they can be subject to change in any upcoming release, with no backward compatibility.
+
If the `Role` or `ClusterRole` objects that are similar are needed, we recommend creating a new object that has exactly the permissions required for the case at hand, rather than using the resources created and maintained by {product-title} Monitoring.
