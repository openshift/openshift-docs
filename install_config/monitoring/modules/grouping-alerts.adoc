== Grouping alerts

_FIXME get missing info and convert to procedure_

Once alerts are firing against the Alertmanager, it must be configured to know how to logically group them.

For this example a new route will be added to reflect alert routing of the "frontend" team.

First, add new routes. Multiple routes may be added beneath the original route, typically to define the receiver for the notification. The following example uses a matcher to ensure that only alerts coming from the service `example-app` are used.

  global:
    resolve_timeout: 5m
  route:
    group_wait: 30s
    group_interval: 5m
    repeat_interval: 12h
    receiver: default
    routes:
    - match:
        alertname: DeadMansSwitch
      repeat_interval: 5m
      receiver: deadmansswitch
    - match:
        service: example-app
      routes:
      - match:
          severity: critical
        receiver: team-frontend-page
  receivers:
  - name: default
  - name: deadmansswitch

The sub-route matches only on alerts that have a severity of `critical`, and sends them via the receiver called `team-frontend-page`. As the name indicates, someone should be paged for alerts that are critical.
