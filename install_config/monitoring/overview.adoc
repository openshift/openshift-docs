{product-title} ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] open source project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster components and ships with a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems and a set of link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana] dashboards.

Highlighted in the diagram above, at the heart of the monitoring stack sits the {product-title} Cluster Monitoring Operator (CMO), which watches over the deployed monitoring components and resources, and ensures that they are always up to date.

The Prometheus Operator (PO) creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Alertmanager instances. It also automatically generates monitoring target configurations based on familiar Kubernetes label queries.

In addition to Prometheus and Alertmanager, {product-title} Monitoring also includes link:https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter[node-exporter] and link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics[kube-state-metrics]. Node-exporter is an agent deployed on every node to collect metrics about it. The kube-state-metrics exporter agent converts Kubernetes objects to metrics consumable by Prometheus.

The targets monitored as part of the cluster monitoring are:

* Prometheus itself
* Prometheus-Operator
* cluster-monitoring-operator
* Alertmanager cluster instances
* Kubernetes apiserver
* kubelets (the kubelet embeds cAdvisor for per container metrics)
* kube-controllers
* kube-state-metrics
* node-exporter
* etcd (if etcd monitoring is enabled)

All these components are automatically updated.

[NOTE]
====
In order to be able to deliver updates with guaranteed compatibility, configurability of the {product-title} Monitoring stack is limited to the explicitly available options.
