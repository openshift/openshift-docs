{product-title} Cluster Monitoring ships with the following alerting rules configured by default. Currently you cannot add custom alerting rules.

Some alerting rules have identical names. This is intentional. They are alerting about the same event with different thresholds, with different severity, or both. With the inhibition rules, the lower severity is inhibited when the higher severity is firing.

For more details on the alerting rules, see the link:https://github.com/openshift/cluster-monitoring-operator/blob/master/assets/prometheus-k8s/rules.yaml[configuration file].
