== Overview
This topic describes how to set up container networking using existing switches
and routers and the kernel networking stack in Linux. The setup requires that
the network administrator or a script modifies the router or routers when new
nodes are added to the cluster.

[NOTE]
The procedures outlined in this topic can be adapted to any type of router.


== Network Layout
The following diagram shows the container networking setup described in this
topic. It uses one Linux node with two network interface cards serving as a
router, two switches, and three nodes connected to these switches.

== Network Overview
The following describes a general network setup:

* 11.11.0.0/16 is the container network.
* The 11.11.x.0/24 subnet is reserved for each node and assigned to the Docker Linux bridge.
* Each node has a route to the router for reaching anything in the 11.11.0.0/16 range, except the local subnet.
* The router has routes for each node, so it can be directed to the right node.
* Existing nodes do not need any changes when new nodes are added, unless the network topology is modified.
* IP forwarding is enabled on each node.

== Node setup

. Assign an unused 11.11.x.0/24 subnet IP address to the Linux bridge on the node:
+
----
# brctl addbr lbr0
# ip addr add 11.11.1.1/24 dev lbr0
# ip link set dev lbr0 up
----

. Modify the Docker startup script to use the new bridge. By default, the
startup script is the `/etc/sysconfig/docker` file:
+
----
# docker -d -b lbr0 --other-options
----

. Add a route to the router for the 11.11.0.0/16 network:
+
----
# ip route add 11.11.0.0/16 via 192.168.2.2 dev p3p1
----

. Enable IP forwarding on the node:
+
----
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

== Router setup
The following procedure assumes a Linux box with multiple NICs is used as a
router. Modify the steps as required to use the syntax for a particular router:

. Enable IP forwarding on the router:
+
----
# sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

. Add a route for each node added to the cluster:
+
----
# ip route add <node_subnet> via <node_ip_address> dev <interface through which node is L2 accessible>
# ip route add 11.11.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1 dev p3p1
# ip route add 11.11.2.0/24 via 192.168.3.3 dev p3p2
# ip route add 11.11.3.0/24 via 192.168.3.4 dev p3p2
