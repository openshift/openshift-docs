== Overview

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you installed {product-title} on servers with x86_64 architecture, your
cluster includes useful sets of Red Hat-provided
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image streams]
and xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[templates] to
make it easy for developers to create new applications. By default, the
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[cluster installation]
process automatically create these sets in the *openshift* project, which is a
default global project to which all users have view access.

If you installed {product-title} on servers with IBM POWER architecture, you
can add  xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image streams]
and xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[templates] to your
cluster.

[[is-templates-before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

Before you consider performing the tasks in this topic, confirm if these image
streams and templates are already registered in your {product-title} cluster by
doing one of the following:

* Log in to the web console and click *Add to Project*.
* List them for the *openshift* project using the CLI:
+
----
$ oc get is -n openshift
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

If
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
you used a method other than the standard
xref:../install/index.adoc#install-planning[cluster installation] process, or if
endif::[]
the default image streams and templates are ever removed or changed, you can
follow this topic to create the default objects yourself. Otherwise, the
following instructions are not necessary.

[[is-templates-prereqs]]
== Prerequisites

Before you can create the default image streams and templates:

- The
xref:../install_config/registry/index.adoc#install-config-registry-overview[integrated container image registry]
service must be deployed in your {product-title} installation.
- You must be able to run the `oc create` command with
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*cluster-admin* privileges],
because they operate on the default *openshift*
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#projects[project].
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- You must have cloned the
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/release-3.11/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples[repository]
that contains the default image streams and templates:
+
----
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- You must have installed the *openshift-ansible* RPM package. See
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#software-prerequisites[Software Prerequisites]
for instructions.
endif::[]
- For on-premise installations on IBM POWER8 or IBM POWER9 servers,
xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#creating-secrets[create a secret] for
`registry.redhat.io` in the `openshift` namespace.
- Define shell variables for the directories containing image streams and templates. This significantly shortens the commands in the following sections. To do this:
+
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
$ IMAGESTREAMDIR=~/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/image-streams; \
    DBTEMPLATES=~/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/db-templates; \
    QSTEMPLATES=~/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/quickstart-templates
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
** For cloud installations and on-premise installations on x86_64 servers:
----
$ IMAGESTREAMDIR="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/image-streams"; \
    XPAASSTREAMDIR="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/xpaas-streams"; \
    XPAASTEMPLATES="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/xpaas-templates"; \
    DBTEMPLATES="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/db-templates"; \
    QSTEMPLATES="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/x86_64/quickstart-templates"
----
** For on-premise installations on IBM POWER8 or IBM POWER9 servers:
----
IMAGESTREAMDIR="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/ppc64le/image-streams"; \
    DBTEMPLATES="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/ppc64le/db-templates"; \
    QSTEMPLATES="/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_examples/files/examples/ppc64le/quickstart-templates"

[[creating-image-streams-for-openshift-images]]
== Creating Image Streams for {product-title} Images

// tag::installconfig_imagestreams_templates[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
If your node hosts are subscribed using Red Hat Subscription Manager and you
want to use the core set of image streams that used Red Hat Enterprise Linux
(RHEL) 7 based images:

----
$ oc create -f $IMAGESTREAMDIR/image-streams-rhel7.json -n openshift
----

Alternatively, to create the core set of image streams that use the CentOS 7
based images:

----
$ oc create -f $IMAGESTREAMDIR/image-streams-centos7.json -n openshift
----

Creating both the CentOS and RHEL sets of image streams is not possible, because
they use the same names. To have both sets of image streams available to users,
either create one set in a different project, or edit one of the files and
modify the image stream names to make them unique.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
You can view all default image streams and their definitions using the CLI. To
get a list of the current objects in the global *openshift* project:

----
$ oc get imagestreams -n openshift
----

To view or modify the definition for a specific image stream:

----
$ oc edit imagestream <imagestream_name> -n openshift
----

If you define your own image stream, first save it to a file, then create it in
the *openshift* project using the CLI:

----
$ oc create -f <file_name> -n openshift
----

This makes the image stream available to all users across the cluster.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]

[[creating-image-streams-for-xpaas-middleware-images]]
== Creating Image Streams for xPaaS Middleware Images
The xPaaS Middleware image streams provide images for *JBoss EAP*, *JBoss JWS*, *JBoss A-MQ*, *Red Hat Fuse on OpenShift*, *Decision Server*, *JBoss Data Virtualization* and *JBoss Data Grid*. They can be
used to build applications for those platforms using the provided templates.

To create the xPaaS Middleware set of image streams:

----
$ oc create -f $XPAASSTREAMDIR/jboss-image-streams.json -n openshift
----

[NOTE]
====
Access to the images referenced by these image streams requires the relevant
xPaaS Middleware subscriptions.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

[[creating-database-service-templates]]
== Creating Database Service Templates

The database service templates make it easy to run a database image which can be
utilized by other components. For each database
(xref:../using_images/db_images/mongodb.adoc#using-images-db-images-mongodb[*MongoDB*],
xref:../using_images/db_images/mysql.adoc#using-images-db-images-mysql[*MySQL*], and
xref:../using_images/db_images/postgresql.adoc#using-images-db-images-postgresql[*PostgreSQL*]),
two templates are defined.

One template uses ephemeral storage in the container which means data stored
will be lost if the container is restarted, for example if the pod moves. This
template should be used for demonstration purposes only.

The other template defines a persistent volume for storage, however it requires
your {product-title} installation to have
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[persistent volumes]
configured.

To create the core set of database templates:

----
$ oc create -f $DBTEMPLATES -n openshift
----

After creating the templates, users are able to easily instantiate the various
templates, giving them quick access to a database deployment.
endif::[]

[[creating-instantapp-templates]]
== Creating Instant App and Quickstart Templates

The Instant App and Quickstart templates define a full set of objects for a running application.
These include:

- xref:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[Build configurations]
to build the application from source located in a GitHub public repository
- xref:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[Deployment configurations]
to deploy the application image after it is built.
- xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[Services]
to provide load balancing for the application
xref:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#pods[pods].
- xref:../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#architecture-core-concepts-routes[Routes]
to provide external access to the application.

Some of the templates also define a database deployment and service so the
application can perform database operations.

[NOTE]
====
The templates which define a database use ephemeral storage for the database
content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only as all
database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====

Using these templates, users are able to easily instantiate full applications
using the various language images provided with {product-title}. They can also
customize the template parameters during instantiation so that it builds source
from their own repository rather than the sample repository, so this provides a
simple starting point for building new applications.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
To create the core Instant App and Quickstart templates:

----
$ oc create -f $QSTEMPLATES -n openshift
----
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
There is also a set of templates for creating applications using various xPaaS
Middleware products (*JBoss EAP*, *JBoss JWS*,
 *JBoss A-MQ*, *Red Hat Fuse on OpenShift*, *Decision Server*, and *JBoss Data Grid*), which can be registered by running:

----
$ oc create -f $XPAASTEMPLATES -n openshift
----

[NOTE]
====
The xPaaS Middleware templates require the
xref:../install_config/imagestreams_templates.adoc#creating-image-streams-for-xpaas-middleware-images[xPaaS Middleware image streams],
which in turn require the relevant xPaaS Middleware
subscriptions.
====

[NOTE]
====
The templates which define a database use ephemeral storage for the database
content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only as all
database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
You can view all default templates and their definitions using the CLI. To get a
list of the current objects in the global *openshift* project:

----
$ oc get templates -n openshift
----

To view or modify the definition for a specific template:

----
$ oc edit template <template_name> -n openshift
----

If you define your own template, first save it to a file, then create it in
the *openshift* project using the CLI:

----
$ oc create -f <file_name> -n openshift
----

This makes the template available to all users across the cluster.

[[what-s-next]]

== What's Next?

With these artifacts created, developers can now
xref:../dev_guide/authentication.adoc#dev-guide-authentication[log in to the web console]
and follow the flow for
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console[creating from a template].
Any of the database or application templates can be selected
to create a running database service or application in the current project. Note
that some of the application templates define their own database services as
well.

The example applications are all built out of GitHub
repositories which are referenced in the templates by default, as seen in the
`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter value. Those repositories can be forked, and
the fork can be provided as the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter value when
creating from the templates. This allows developers to experiment with creating
their own applications.

You can direct your developers to the
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#using-the-instantapp-templates[Using the Instant App and Quickstart Templates]
section in the Developer Guide for these instructions.
