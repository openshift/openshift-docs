== Overview

{product-title} clusters can be provisioned with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage]
using Ceph RBD.

Persistent volumes (PVs) and
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent volume claims (PVCs)]
can share volumes across a single project. While the Ceph RBD-specific
information contained in a PV definition could also be defined directly in a pod
definition, doing so does not create the volume as a distinct cluster resource,
making the volume more susceptible to conflicts.

This topic presumes some familiarity with {product-title} and
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ceph-storage[Ceph RBD].
See the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[Persistent
Storage] concept topic for details on the {product-title} persistent volume (PV)
framework in general.

[NOTE]

_Project_ and _namespace_ are used interchangeably throughout this document. See
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#namespaces[Projects
and Users] for details on the relationship.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[[ceph-provisioning]]
== Provisioning

To provision Ceph volumes, the following are required:

- An existing storage device in your underlying infrastructure.
- The Ceph key to be used in an {product-title} secret object.
- The Ceph image name.
- The file system type on top of the block storage (e.g., ext4).
- *ceph-common* installed on each schedulable {product-title} node in your cluster:
+
----
# yum install ceph-common
----

[[creating-ceph-secret]]
=== Creating the Ceph Secret

Define the authorization key in a secret configuration, which is then converted to base64 for use by {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
In order to use Ceph storage to back a persistent volume, the secret must be created in the same project as the PVC and pod. The secret cannot simply be in the default project.
====

. Run `ceph auth get-key` on a Ceph MON node to display the key value for the
`client.admin` user:
+
====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ceph-secret
data:
  key: QVFBOFF2SlZheUJQRVJBQWgvS2cwT1laQUhPQno3akZwekxxdGc9PQ==
type: kubernetes.io/rbd

----
====

. Save the secret definition to a file, for example *_ceph-secret.yaml_*, then
create the secret:
+
====
----
$ oc create -f ceph-secret.yaml
----
====

. Verify that the secret was created:
+
====
----
# oc get secret ceph-secret
NAME          TYPE               DATA      AGE
ceph-secret   kubernetes.io/rbd  1         23d

[[ceph-creating-pv]]
=== Creating the Persistent Volume

Developers request Ceph RBD storage by referencing either a PVC, or the Gluster
volume plug-in directly in the `*volumes*` section of a pod specification. A PVC
exists only in the user's namespace and can be referenced only by pods within
that same namespace. Any attempt to access a PV from a different namespace
causes the pod to fail.

. Define the PV in an object definition before creating it in {product-title}:
+
.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using Ceph RBD

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: ceph-pv <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi <2>
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <3>
  rbd: <4>

    user: admin
    secretRef:
      name: ceph-secret <6>
    fsType: ext4 <7>
    readOnly: false
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
----
<1> The name of the PV that is referenced in pod definitions or displayed in
various `oc` volume commands.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> `accessModes` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control. All block storage is defined to be
single user (non-shared storage).
<4> The volume type being used, in this case the *rbd* plug-in.
<5> An array of Ceph monitor IP addresses and ports.
<6> The Ceph secret used to create a secure connection from {product-title} to the Ceph server.
<7> The file system type mounted on the Ceph RBD block device.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `*fstype*` parameter after the volume has been
formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.
====

. Save your definition to a file, for example *_ceph-pv.yaml_*, and create the
PV:
+
====
----
# oc create -f ceph-pv.yaml
----
====

. Verify that the persistent volume was created:
+
====
----
# oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
ceph-pv                  <none>    2147483648   RWO           Available                       2s

----
<1> The `*accessModes*` do not enforce access right, but instead act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim looks for PVs offering `*2Gi*` or greater capacity.
====

. Save the definition to a file, for example *_ceph-claim.yaml_*, and create the
PVC:

[[ceph-volume-security]]
== Ceph Volume Security

[NOTE]
====
See the full
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-pod-security-context[Volume
Security] topic before implementing Ceph RBD volumes.
====

A significant difference between shared volumes (NFS and GlusterFS) and block
volumes (Ceph RBD, iSCSI, and most cloud storage), is that the user and group
IDs defined in the pod definition or container image are applied to the target
physical storage. This is referred to as managing ownership of the block device.
For example, if the Ceph RBD mount has its owner set to *123* and its group ID
set to *567*, and if the pod defines its `runAsUser` set to *222* and its
`fsGroup` to be *7777*, then the Ceph RBD physical mount's ownership will be
changed to *222:7777*.

[NOTE]
====
Even if the user and group IDs are not defined in the pod specification, the
resulting pod may have defaults defined for these IDs based on its matching SCC,
or its project. See the full
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-pod-security-context[Volume
Security] topic which covers storage aspects of SCCs and defaults in greater
detail.
====

A pod defines the group ownership of a Ceph RBD volume using the `*fsGroup*`
stanza under the pod's `securityContext` definition:

====
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
    - name:
    ...
  securityContext: <1>
    fsGroup: 7777 <2>
----
<1> The `securityContext` must be defined at the pod level, not under a specific container.
<2> All containers in the pod will have the same fsGroup ID.
====
