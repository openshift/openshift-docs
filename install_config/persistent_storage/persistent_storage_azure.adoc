== Overview
{product-title} supports
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/disks/[Microsoft Azure
Disk] volumes. You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] using Azure. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure is assumed.

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
volume] framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent
storage and gives users a way to request those resources without having any
knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace;
they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[Persistent
volume claims], however, are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[azure-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

Before creating persistent volumes using Azure, ensure your {product-title}
cluster meets the following requirements:

* {product-title} must first be
xref:../../install_config/configuring_azure.adoc#install-config-configuring-azure[configured
for Azure Disk].
* Each node host in the infrastructure must match the Azure virtual machine name.
* Each node host must be in the same resource group.


[[azure-provisioning]]
== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in {product-title}. After ensuring {product-title} is
xref:../../install_config/configuring_azure.adoc#install-config-configuring-azure[configured
for Azure Disk], all that is required for {product-title} and Azure is an Azure
Disk Name and Disk URI and the `PersistentVolume` API.

[[azure-disk-regional-cloud]]
== Configuring Azure Disk for regional cloud

Azure has multiple regions on which to deploy an instance. To specify a desired region, add the following to the *_azure.conf_* file:

----
cloud: <region>
----

The region can be any of the following:

* German cloud: `AZUREGERMANCLOUD`
* China cloud: `AZURECHINACLOUD`
* Public cloud: `AZUREPUBLICCLOUD`
* US cloud: `AZUREUSGOVERNMENTCLOUD`

=== Creating the Persistent Volume

[NOTE]
====
Azure does not support the *Recycle* reclaim policy.
====

You must define your persistent volume in an object definition before creating
it in {product-title}:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using Azure
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  azureDisk: <3>
    diskName: test2.vhd <4>
    diskURI: https://someacount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/test2.vhd <5>
    cachingMode: ReadWrite  <6>
    fsType: ext4  <7>
    readOnly: false  <8>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This will be how it is identified via
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> This defines the volume type being used (*azureDisk* plug-in, in this example).
<4> The name of the data disk in the blob storage.
<5> The URI of the data disk in the blob storage.
<6> Host caching mode: None, ReadOnly, or ReadWrite.
<7> File system type to mount (for example, `ext4`, `xfs`, and so on).
<8> Defaults to `false` (read/write). `ReadOnly` here will force the `ReadOnly` setting in `VolumeMounts`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `fsType` parameter after the volume is formatted and
provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.
====

. Save your definition to a file, for example *_azure-pv.yaml_*, and create the
persistent volume:
+
----
# oc create -f azure-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----

. Verify that the persistent volume was created:
+
----
# oc get pv
NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWO           Available                       2s
----

Now you can
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[request
storage using persistent volume claims], which can now use your new persistent
volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a pod that has a mounted volume through an Azure disk PVC, scheduling the
pod to a new node takes a few minutes. Wait for two to three minutes to complete
the  _Disk Detach_ operation, and then start a new deployment. If a new pod
creation request is started before completing the _Disk Detach_ operation, the
_Disk Attach_  operation initiated by the pod creation fails, resulting in pod
creation failure.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volume claims only exist in the user's namespace and can only be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
persistent volume from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
====

[[volume-format-azure]]

=== Volume Format
Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks
that it contains a file system as specified by the `fsType` parameter in the
persistent volume definition. If the device is not formatted with the file
system, all data from the device is erased and the device is automatically
formatted with the given file system.

This allows unformatted Azure volumes to be used as persistent volumes because
{product-title} formats them before the first use.
