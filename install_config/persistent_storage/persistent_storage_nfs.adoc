== Overview

OpenShift clusters can be provisioned with
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using NFS
Some familiarity with Openshift,
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[persistent volume claims (PVCs)],
and https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch-nfs.html[NFS] is beneficial.

The Openshift persistent volume (PV) framework allows administrators to provision a cluster
with persistent storage and gives developers the ability to request those resources without
having specific knowledge of the underlying infrastructure. Persistent volumes are not bound
to a single project; they can be shared across the entire OpenShift cluster. Persistent volume
claims (PVCs), however, are specific to a project and are created and used by developers.

(Note: "project" and "namespace" are used interchangeably throughout this document)

== Provisioning

Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in
OpenShift. To provision NFS volumes a list of NFS servers and export paths are all that is
required.

A PV spec file is usually defined before creating the PV:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001 <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi <2>
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce <3>
  nfs: <4>
    path: /tmp <5>
    server: 172.17.0.2 <6>
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle <7>
```
<1> the name of the volume. This is the PV identify in various `oc ... pod` commands.
<2> the amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> though this appears to be related to controlling access to the volume, in fact, it
is actually used similarly to labels and used to match a PVC to a PV. Currently, no
access rules are enforced based on the `accessModes`.
<4> this defines the volume type being used, in this case the *nfs* plug-in.
<5> the path that is exported by the NFS server.
<6> the host name or IP address of the NFS server.
<7> defines what happens to a volume when released from its claim. Valid options
are *Retain* (default) and *Recycle*. See
link:#nfs-reclaiming-resources[Reclaiming Resources].

Save the definition to a file, for example *_nfs-pv.yaml_*, and create the persistent
volume:
```
# oc create -f nfs-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
```

Verify that the persistent volume was created:
```
# oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001                   <none>    5368709120   RWO           Available                       31s
```

The next step can be to create a persistent volume claim (PV) which will bind to the new PV.
This is easy to do, as shown in the "nfs-claim.yaml example below:
```
#claim yaml file: "nfs-claim.yaml"

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: nfs-claim1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce <1>
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi <2>

# oc create -f nfs-claim.yaml
```
<1> as mentioned above for PVs, the `accessModes` do not enforce security, but rather act as
labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> this claim will look for PVs offering 1Gi or greater capacity.

*Note:* PVs, and PVCs are not necessary, just convenient and make sharing a volume across a
project simpler. The NFS specific information contained in the PV spec can also be defined
directly in a pod spec.

[[nfs-enforcing-disk-quotas]]
=== Enforcing Disk Quotas
Disk partitions can be used to enforce disk quotas and size constraints. Each partition
can be its own export. Each export is one persistent volume (PV). Openshift enforces
unique names for PVs, but the uniqueness of the NFS volume's server and path is up to
the administrator.

Enforcing quotas in this way allows the developer to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

[[nfs-volume-security]]
== Volume Security
This section covers aspects of Security Context Constraints (SCCs), which are described
elsewhere, see
link:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.html[managing SCCs] and
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[SCC concepts].
The reader is expected to understand the basics of POSIX permissions, process UIDs,
supplemental groups, and selinux.

*NOTE:* The
link:pod_security_context.html[pod and storage security] document should be read before
implementing NFS volumes.

Developers request NFS storage by referencing, in the `volumes` section of their
pod spec, either a _PersistentVolumeClaim_ by name, or the NFS volume plugin directly.

The *_/etc/exports_* file, on the NFS server, contains the accessible NFS directories.
The target NFS directory has the familiar POSIX owner and group ids. The Openshift NFS
plug-in mounts the container's NFS directory with the same POSIX ownership and permissions
found on the exported NFS directory. However, the container is not run with its effective
UID equal to the owner of the NFS mount, which is the desired behavior.

As an example, if the target NFS directory appears as:
```
#on the nfs server:
# ls -lZ /opt/nfs -d
drwxrws---. nobody 5555 unconfined_u:object_r:usr_t:s0   /opt/nfs

# id nobody
uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody)
```
then the container will need to match selinux labels, and either run with a UID of 99
(_nobody_ owner), or with 5555 in its supplemental groups in order to access the directory.

=== User IDs
User ids can be defined in the container image or in the pod spec. The
link:pod_security_context.html#user-id[pod and storage security] document covers
controlling storage access based on user ids.

The container needs it's UID set to 99 (ignoring group ids for the moment), so the
following fragement can be added to the pod spec:
```
spec:
  containers: <1>
  - name: ...
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 99  #nobody
```
<1> pods contain a `securtityContext` specific to each container (shown above) and a global
`securityContext` which applies to all containers defined in the pod.

Assuming the _default_ project and the _restricted_ SCC, the pod's requested user id of 99
will, unfortunetely, *not* be allowed, and therefore the pod will fail. The pod fails because:

- it requests 99 as its user id,
- all SCCs available to the pod are examined to see which SCC will allow a user id of 99
(actually, all policies of the SCCs are checked but the  focus here is on user id),
- since all available SCCs use _MustRunAsRange_ for their `runAsUser` strategy, uid
range checking is required, 
- 99 is not included in the SCC or namespace's user id range, so the pod fails.

To best way to fix this situation is to create a custom SCC.

===== Custom SCC for User IDs
It's generally considered a good practice to *not* modify the predefined SCCs. The preferred
approach is to create a custom SCC that better fits an organization's security needs, or
create a new project that supports the desired user ids. See
link:../../dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project[projects] if interested in creating
a new project.

A custom SCC can be created such that a min and max user ids are defined, UID range
checking is still enforced, and the UID of 99 will be allowed. Here is an exert:
```
# oc export scc nfs-scc <1>
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false  #the allow* bools are the same as for the restricted scc
...
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  ...
  name: nfs-scc <1>
priority: 9 <2>
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsRange <3>
  uidRangeMax: 99 <4>
  uidRangeMin: 99
...
```
<1> the name of the new SCC is "nfs-scc"
<2> numerically larger numbers have greater priority, nil or omitted is the lowest priority.
Higher priority SCCs sort before lower pri SCCs and thus have a better chance of matching a new pod
<3> `runAsUser:` is a strategy and it is set to _MustRunAsRange_, which means uid range checking is 
enforced
<4> the uid range is 99-99 (a range of one value). The min value, 99, would become the user id
default is a user id was not supplied in the pod spec.

Now, using `runAsUser: 99`, shown in the pod fragment above, the pod matches the "nfs-scc"
and is able to run with a UID of 99.

=== Group IDs
Another way to handle NFS access (assuming it's not a choice to change permissions on the NFS mount)
is to use supplemental groups. Supplemental groups in Openshift are used for shared storage, of which
NFS is an exmaple. In contrast, block storage, such as Ceph RBD or iSCSI, use the `fsGroup:` SCC strategy
and  the `fsGroup:` value in the pod's `securityContext:`.

*NOTE:* this is covered in the
link:pod_security_context.adoc#supplemental-groups[pod and storage security] document.

Since the group id on the link:#nfs-export[target NFS directory], shown above, is 5555,
the pod can define that group id using `suplementalGroups` under pod's global
`securityContext` definition. For example:
```
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ...
      #runAsUser: 99 from above has been commented out here
  securityContext: <1>
    supplementalGroups: [5555] #an array of GIDs defined globally for the pod
```
<1> securityContext here is defined globally to the pod, not under a specific container

Since group id is the focus here, it's worth seeing the ranges defined for the _default_
project:
```
# oc export ns default 
...
metadata:
  annotations:
    ...
    openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups: 1000000000/10000 <1>
    openshift.io/sa.scc.uid-range: 1000000000/10000
...
```
<1> this is the preallocated range for group ids. Additionally, the min value of the range
(1000000000) becomes the GID default if a group id is not specified in the pod or image.
The suggestion below does not modify the project's range of allowed group ids, but that
could be an option for some projects.

Assuming the _default_ namespace and the "nfs-scc" SCC are being used:

- the "nfs-sec" SCC (which has its `supplementalGroups` strategy set as _MustRunAs_) will
not satisfy the pod's requirements. This is due to the pod defining a group id but "nfs-sec"
does not contain any group id ranges. Since "nfs-scc" is not the last SCC to be examined (its
priority is 9 compared to nil for other SCCs), the remaining SCCs are examined.
- the _restricted_ SCC, which typically is the last SCC used to attempt to statisy a pod's 
requirements, has its `supplementalGroups` strategy set to _RunAsAny_, and therefore it
statisfies the pod, and, thus, the pod will start.

==== Custom SCC for Group IDs
If GID range checking is desired, and none of the predefined SCCs are to be edited, then the
new "nfs-scc" can be modified to support this reqirement, as seen below:
```
#after: oc edit scc nfs-scc
...
# oc export scc nfs-scc 
...
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
...
  name: nfs-scc
priority: 9
...
supplementalGroups:
  ranges: <2>
  - max: 6000
    min: 5000
  type: MustRunAs <1>
```
<1> _MustRunAs_ triggers gid range checking
<2> the min and max values are defined in the SCC, therefore the SCC statisfies the need for
range checking, and thus the namespace's `openshift.io/sa.scc.supplemental-groups` range is
not needed.

Only the "nfs-scc" has been changed. The pod spec (fragment shown just above) does not need any
changes, and the _default_ namespace also remains the same. After creating the pod:
```
# oc create -f nfs-pod.yaml
...
# oc get pod nfs-pod1 -0 yaml
...
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/scc: nfs-scc <1>
  name: nfs-pod1
  namespace: default <2>
...
spec:
  containers:
    ...
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 1000000000 <3>
 ...
 securityContext:
    seLinuxOptions:
     level: s0:c1,c0
    supplementalGroups:
    - 5555 <3>
...
# oc rsh nfs-pod1 id
uid=1000000000 gid=0(root) groups=5555 <3>
```
<1> verifying that the "nfs-scc" matched the pod.
<2> the namespace is _default_
<3> verififying that the running container has the default user id (1000000000) and
supplemental groups of 5555

=== SELinux
All predefined SCCs, except for the _privileged_ SCC, set the `seLinuxContext:` to _MustRunAs_.
This forces the pod to use a selinux policy, which can be defined in the pod spec. See the
fragment below:
```
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ...
  securityContext:
    type: MustRunAs
    SELinuxOptions: <1>
      user: selinux-user-name
      role: selinux-role-name
      type: selinux-type-label
      level: selinux-level
```
<1> selinux policy is defined in the context of a container, but it can also be set global to the pod.

If selinux is not defined in the pod spec then it defaults to the selinux policy defined in the pod's
matching SCC, or, if absent in the SCC, then the namespace's `sa.scc.mcs:` value is used. 

...
An SELinuxContext strategy of MustRunAs with no level set. Admission looks for the openshift.io/sa.scc.mcs annotation to populate the level.
...
ausearch -m avc --start recent
...
# setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_nfs on
The virt_sandbox_use_nfs boolean is defined by the docker-selinux package. If you get an error saying it is not defined, please ensure that this package is installed.
...

*NOTE:*
The `accessModes:` section of the PV and the PVC provide no access
enforcement. They are used similarly to labels and match a PVC to a PV, nothing more. For example,
the NFS PV's `accessModes:` can be set to _ReadOnlyMany_ yet the container, depending on its user
and group ids could have write access to that PV.

*NOTE:*
Each NFS volume must be mountable by all nodes in the cluster.

[[nfs-reclaiming-resources]]

== Reclaiming Resources
NFS implements the Kubernetes *Recyclable* plug-in interface. Automatic
processes handle reclamation tasks based on policies set on each persistent
volume.

By default, persistent volumes are set to *Retain*. NFS volumes which are set to
*Recycle* are scrubbed (i.e., `rm -rf` is run on the volume) after being
released from their claim (i.e, after the user's `*PersistentVolumeClaim*` bound
to the volume is deleted). Once recycled, the NFS volume can be bound to a new
claim.

[[nfs-automation]]

== Automation
As discussed, clusters can be provisioned with persistent storage using NFS in
the following way:

- Disk partitions can be used to link:#nfs-enforcing-disk-quotas[enforce storage
quotas].
- Security can be enforced by link:#nfs-volume-security[restricting volumes] to
the namespace that has a claim to them.
- link:#nfs-reclaiming-resources[Reclamation of discarded resources] can be
configured for each persistent volume.

They are many ways that you can use scripts to automate the above tasks. You can
use an
link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/tree/master/roles/kube_nfs_volumes[example
Ansible playbook] to help you get started.

[[selinux-and-nfs-export-settings]]

== SELinux and NFS Export Settings
By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote NFS server.
The NFS volume mounts correctly, but is read-only.

To enable writing to NFS volumes with SELinux enforcing on each node, run:

----
# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
----

The `-P` option makes the bool persistent between reboots.

Additionally, in order to enable arbitrary container users to read and write the
volume, each exported volume on the NFS server itself should conform to the
following:

- Each export must be:
+
----
/<example_fs> *(rw,root_squash)
----
- The firewall must be configured to allow traffic to the mount point. The default port is 2049:
+
----
# iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 2049 -j ACCEPT
----
- The NFS export and directory must be set up so that it is accessible by your
pods. Either set the export to be owned by the container's primary UID, or give
your pod group based access using `*SuppplementalGroups*`. See
link:pod_security_context.html[Volume Security] for more information.
