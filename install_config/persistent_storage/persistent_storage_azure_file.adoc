== Overview

{product-title} supports Azure File volumes. You can provision your
{product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] using
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/[Azure]. Some
familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure is assumed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[NOTE]
====
Azure File does not support the *Recycle* recycling policy.

[[creating-azure-storage-account-secret]]
== Creating the Azure Storage Account Secret

Define the Azure Storage Account name and key in a secret configuration, which
is then converted to base64 for use by {product-title}.

. Obtain an Azure Storage Account name and key and encode to base64:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: azure-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  azurestorageaccountname: azhzdGVzdA==
  azurestorageaccountkey: eElGMXpKYm5ub2pGTE1Ta0JwNTBteDAyckhzTUsyc2pVN21GdDRMMTNob0I3ZHJBYUo4akQ2K0E0NDNqSm9nVjd5MkZVT2hRQ1dQbU02WWFOSHk3cWc9PQ==
----

. Save the secret definition to a file, for example *_azure-secret.yaml_*, then
create the secret:
+
----
$ oc create -f azure-secret.yaml
----

. Verify that the secret was created:
+
----
# oc get secret azure-secret
NAME          TYPE      DATA      AGE
azure-secret   Opaque    1         23d
----

You must define your persistent volume in an object definition before creating
it in {product-title}:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using Azure File

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5120Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteMany"
  azureFile: <3>
    secretName: azure-secret <4>
    shareName: example <5>
    readOnly: false <6>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This will be how it is identified via
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> This defines the volume type being used: *azureFile* plug-in.
<4> The name of the secret used.
<5> The name of the file share.
<6> Defaults to `false` (read/write). `ReadOnly` here will force the `ReadOnly` setting in `VolumeMounts`.

. Save your definition to a file, for example *_azure-file-pv.yaml_*, and create the
persistent volume:
+
----
# oc create -f azure-file-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----

. Verify that the persistent volume was created:
+
----
# oc get pv
NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWM           Available                       2s
----

Now you can
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[request
storage using persistent volume claims], which can now use your new persistent
volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volume claims only exist in the user's namespace and can only be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
persistent volume from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
