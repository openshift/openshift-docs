== Overview

{product-title} supports
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/[Microsoft Azure
File] volumes. You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] using Azure. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Azure is assumed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[[azure-file-before-you-begin]]
== Before you begin
. Install `samba-client`, `samba-common`, and `cifs-utils` on all nodes:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ sudo yum install samba-client samba-common cifs-utils
----

. Enable SELinux booleans on all nodes:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ /usr/sbin/setsebool -P virt_use_samba on
$ /usr/sbin/setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_samba on
----

. Run the `mount` command to check `dir_mode` and `file_mode` permissions, for example:
+
----
$ mount
----

If the `dir_mode` and `file_mode` permissions are set to `0755`,  change the
default value `0755` to `0777` or `0775`. This manual step is required because
the default `dir_mode` and `file_mode` permissions changed from `0777` to `0755`
in {product-title} 3.9. The following examples show configuration files with the
changed values.

.Considerations when using MySQL and PostgreSQL with Azure file
* The owner UID of the Azure File mounted directory is different from the UID of a container.
* MySQL containers change the file owner permission in the mounted directory. Because of the mismatch between the owner UID and container process UID, this operation fails. Therefore to run MySQL with Azure File:
** Specify the Azure File mounted directory UID in the `runAsUser` variable in the PV configuration file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
    ...
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: <mounted_dir_uid>
----
** Specify the container process UID under `mountOptions` in the PV configuration file.
+
[source, yaml]
----
mountOptions:
  - dir_mode=0700
  - file_mode=0600
  - uid=<container_process_uid>
  - gid=0
----

* PostgreSQL does not work with Azure file. This is because PostgreSQL requires
hard links in the Azure File directory, and since Azure File does not support
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/features-not-supported-by-the-azure-file-service[hard
links] the pod fails to start.

.PV configuration file example
[source,yaml]
----
# azf-pv.yml
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "azpv"
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "1Gi"
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteMany"
  azureFile:
    secretName: azure-secret
    shareName: azftest
    readOnly: false
  mountOptions:
    - dir_mode=0777
    - file_mode=0777

----
$ azure-file-sc.yaml

[[azure-file-regional-cloud]]
== Configuring Azure File for regional cloud

While
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_azure.adoc#azure-disk-regional-cloud[Azure
Disk is compatible with multiple regional clouds], Azure File supports only the
Azure public cloud, because the endpoint is hard-coded.

[[creating-azure-storage-account-secret]]
== Creating the Azure Storage Account secret

Define the Azure Storage Account name and key in a secret configuration, which
is then converted to base64 for use by {product-title}.

. Obtain an Azure Storage Account name and key and encode to base64:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: azure-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  azurestorageaccountname: azhzdGVzdA==
  azurestorageaccountkey: eElGMXpKYm5ub2pGTE1Ta0JwNTBteDAyckhzTUsyc2pVN21GdDRMMTNob0I3ZHJBYUo4akQ2K0E0NDNqSm9nVjd5MkZVT2hRQ1dQbU02WWFOSHk3cWc9PQ==
----

. Save the secret definition to a file, for example *_azure-secret.yaml_*, then
create the secret:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f azure-secret.yaml
----

. Verify that the secret was created:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get secret azure-secret
NAME          TYPE      DATA      AGE
azure-secret   Opaque    1         23d
----

. Define the PV in an object definition before creating
it in {product-title}:
+
.PV object definition using Azure File example
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteMany"
  azureFile: <3>
    secretName: azure-secret <4>
    shareName: example <5>
    readOnly: false <6>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This is how it is identified via
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[PV claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> This defines the volume type being used: *azureFile* plug-in.
<4> The name of the secret used.
<5> The name of the file share.
<6> Defaults to `false` (read/write). `ReadOnly` here forces the `ReadOnly` setting in `VolumeMounts`.

. Save your definition to a file, for example *_azure-file-pv.yaml_*, and create the PV:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f azure-file-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----

. Verify that the PV was created:
+
[source, bash]
----
$ oc get pv
NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWM           Available                       2s
----

You can now
xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[request
storage using PV claims], which can now use your new PV.

[IMPORTANT]
====
PV claims only exist in the user's namespace and can only be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
PV from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
