== Overview
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage]
using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform/version-7/red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform-7-architecture-guide/chapter-1-components#comp-cinder[OpenStack
Cinder]. Some familiarity with Kubernetes and OpenStack is assumed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you create persistent volumes (PVs) using Cinder,
xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[configured
{product-title} for OpenStack].
====

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.
You can xref:dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[provision]
OpenStack Cinder volumes dynamically.

Persistent volumes are not bound to a single
project or namespace; they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[Persistent
volume claims], however, are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[cinder-provisioning]]
== Provisioning Cinder PVs
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in {product-title}. After ensuring that {product-title} is
xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[configured for OpenStack],
all that is required for Cinder is a Cinder volume ID and the
`*PersistentVolume*` API.

[[cinder-creating-persistent-volume]]
=== Creating the Persistent Volume

[NOTE]
====
Cinder does not support the 'Recycle' reclaim policy.
====

You must define your PV in an object definition before creating
it in {product-title}:

. Save your object definition to a file, for example *_cinder-pv.yaml_*:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  cinder: <3>
    fsType: "ext3" <4>
    volumeID: "f37a03aa-6212-4c62-a805-9ce139fab180" <5>
----
<1> The name of the volume that is used by 
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> The volume type, in this case *cinder*.
<4> File system type to mount.
<5> The Cinder volume to use.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not change the `*fstype*` parameter value after the volume is formatted and
provisioned. Changing this value can result in data loss and pod failure.
====

. Create the persistent volume:
+
----
# oc create -f cinder-pv.yaml

persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----

. Verify that the persistent volume exists:
+
----
# oc get pv

NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWO           Available                       2s
----

Users can then xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[request storage
using persistent volume claims], which can now utilize your new persistent
volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volume claims exist only in the user's namespace and can be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
persistent volume claim from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
====

[[volume-format-cinder]]
=== Cinder PV format
Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks
that it contains a file system as specified by the `*fsType*` parameter in the
persistent volume definition. If the device is not formatted with the file
system, all data from the device is erased and the device is automatically
formatted with the given file system.

This allows using unformatted Cinder volumes as persistent volumes, because
{product-title} formats them before the first use.

[[volume-security-cinder]]
=== Cinder volume security

If you use Cinder PVs in your application, configure security for their
deployment configurations.

[NOTE]
====
Review the 
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-pod-security-context[Volume
Security] information before implementing Cinder volumes.
====

. Create an xref:../../admin_guide/manage_scc.adoc#creating-new-security-context-constraints[SCC]
that uses the appropriate `*fsGroup*` strategy.

. Create a service account and add it to the SCC:
+
----
[source,bash]
$ oc create serviceaccount <service_account>
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <new_scc> -z <service_account> -n <project>
----

. In your application's deployment configuration, provide the service account
name and `*securityContext*`:
+
[source,yaml]
----

<3> A template for the pod the controller creates.
