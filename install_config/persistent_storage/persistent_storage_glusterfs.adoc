[[considerations]]
== Considerations

This section covers a few topics that should be taken into consideration when
using {gluster} with {product-title}.

[[considerations-software-prereqs]]
=== Software Prerequisites

[[considerations-volume-ops]]
=== Volume Operation Behaviors

include::install_config/persistent_storage/topics/glusterfs_volume_ops.adoc[]

[[considerations-volume-security]]
=== Volume Security

This section covers {gluster} volume security, including Portable Operating
System Interface [for Unix] (POSIX) permissions and SELinux considerations.
Understanding the basics of xref:pod_security_context.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-pod-security-context[Volume Security],
POSIX permissions, and SELinux is presumed.

[[install]]
== Installation

For standalone {gluster}, there is no component installation required to use it
with {product-title}. {product-title} comes with a built-in GlusterFS volume
driver, allowing it to make use of existing volumes on existing clusters. See
xref:provisioning[provisioning] for more on how to make use of existing volumes.

For {gluster-native} and {gluster-external}, it is recommended to use the
xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installer] to install the
required components.

[[install-gluster-nodes]]
=== {gluster-external}: Installing {gluster} Nodes

include::install_config/persistent_storage/topics/glusterfs_install_nodes.adoc[]

[[install-advanced-installer]]
=== Using the Advanced Installer

The xref:../../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[Advanced Installer]
can be used to install one or both of two GlusterFS node groups:

- `glusterfs`: A general storage cluster for use by user applications.
- `glusterfs-registry`: A dedicated storage cluster for use by infrastructure
applications such as an integrated OpenShift Container Registry.

It is recommended to deploy both groups to avoid potential impacts on
performance in I/O and volume creation. Both of these are defined in the
inventory hosts file.

The definition of the clusters is done by including the relevant names in the
`[OSEv3:children]` group, creating similarly named groups, and then populating
the groups with the node information. The clusters can then be configured
through a variety of variables in the `[OSEv3:vars]` group. `glusterfs`
variables begin with `openshift_storage_glusterfs_` and `glusterfs-registry`
variables begin with `openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_`. A few other
variables, such as `openshift_hosted_registry_storage_kind`, interact with the
GlusterFS clusters.

It is recommended to specify version tags for all containerized components.
This is primarily to prevent components, particularly the {gluster} pods, from
upgrading after an outage which may lead to a cluster of widely disparate
software versions. The relevant variables are:

- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_block_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_s3_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_heketi_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_block_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_s3_version`
- `openshift_storage_glusterfs_registry_heketi_version`

For a complete list of variables, see the
link:{gluster-role-link}[GlusterFS role README] on GitHub.

Once the variables are configured, there are several playbooks available
depending on the circumstances of the installation:

- The main playbook of the Advanced Installer can be used to deploy the
GlusterFS clusters in tandem with an initial installation of {product-title}.
  ** This includes deploying an integrated OpenShift Container Registry that
  uses GlusterFS storage.
  ** This does not include OpenShift Logging or OpenShift Metrics, as that is
  currently still a separate step. See link:install-example-infra[{gluster-native} for OpenShift Logging and Metrics]
  for more information.
- `playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/config.yml` can be used to deploy the clusters
onto an existing {product-title} installation.
- `playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/registry.yml` can be used to deploy the
clusters onto an existing {product-title} installation. In addition, this will
deploy an integrated OpenShift Container Registry which uses GlusterFS storage.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
There must not be a pre-existing registry in the {product-title} cluster.
====
- `playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml` can be used to remove existing
clusters matching the configuration in the inventory hosts file. This is useful
for cleaning up the {product-title} environment in the case of a failed
deployment due to configuration errors.
+
[NOTE]
====
The GlusterFS playbooks are not guaranteed to be idempotent. Running the playbooks more than once for a given installation is currently not supported without deleting the entire GlusterFS installation (including disk data) and starting over.

[[provisioning]]
== Provisioning

GlusterFS volumes can be provisioned either statically or dynamically. Static
provisioning is available with all configurations. Only {gluster-native} and
{gluster-external} support dynamic provisioning.
