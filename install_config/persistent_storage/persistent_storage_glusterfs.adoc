== Overview

You can configure your {product-title} cluster to use Red Hat Gluster Storage as
persistent storage for containerized applications. There are two deployment
solutions available when using Red Hat Gluster Storage, using either a
containerized or dedicated storage cluster. This topic focuses mainly on the the
persistent volume plug-in solution using a dedicated Red Hat Gluster Storage
cluster.

[[gfs-containerized-storage-cluster]]
=== Containerized Red Hat Gluster Storage

Starting with the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 update 3 release, you can deploy
containerized Red Hat Gluster Storage directly on {product-title}. Containerized
Red Hat Gluster Storage converged with {product-title} addresses the use case
where containerized applications require both shared file storage and the
flexibility of a converged infrastructure with compute and storage instances
being scheduled and run from the same set of hardware.

.Architecture - Red Hat Gluster Storage Container Converged with OpenShift
image::OpenShift_Containerization_Gluster_412816_0716_JCS_converged.png["Architecture - Red Hat Gluster Storage Container Converged with OpenShift"]

Step-by-step instructions for this containerized solution are provided
separately in the following Red Hat Gluster Storage documentation:

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/container-native_storage_for_openshift_container_platform/[Container-Native Storage for OpenShift Container Platform]

[[container-native-storage-recommendations]]
=== Container Native Storage Recommendations

{product-title} offers container native storage (CNS) storage, which makes it
easier for {product-title} users to fulfill their storage needs. With CNS,
solution users and administrators are empowered to have storage and application
pods running together on the same infrastructure and sharing the same resources.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/container-native_storage_for_openshift_container_platform/[Container-Native Storage for OpenShift Container Platform] for configuring CNS as part of an
{product-title} cluster.

[[volumes-creation-time-for-container-native-storage]]
==== Creation Time of Volumes with Container Native Storage

Building environment storage can influence the time it takes for an application
to start. For example, if the application pod requires a persistent volume claim
(PVC), then extra time might have to be considered for CNS to be created and
bound to the corresponding PVC. This effects the build time for an application
pod to start.

Creation time of CNS volumes scales linearly up to 100 volumes. In the latest
tests, each volume took approximately 6 seconds to be created, allocated, and
bound to a pod.

All tests were performed on one trusted storage pool (TSP), using hardware
configuration for CNS per the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/container-native_storage_for_openshift_container_platform/[Container-Native Storage for OpenShift Container Platform] guidelines.

Dynamic storage provisioning and storage classes were also configured and used
when provisioning the PVC.

[[volumes-deletion-time-for-container-native-storage]]
==== Deletion Time of Volumes with Container Native Storage

When you delete a PVC that is used by an application pod, then that action
will trigger the deletion of the CNS volume that was used by the PVC.

PVCs will disappear immediately from the `oc get pvc` output. However, the time
to delete and recycle CNS volumes depends on the number of CNS volumes. In the
latest tests, the deletion time of CNS volumes proved to scale linearly up to
100 volumes.

[NOTE]
====
Deletion time does not affect application users. CNS deletion behavior serves as
orientation for CNS storage administrators to be able to estimate how long it
will approximately take for CNS volumes to be removed from a CNS cluster.
====

[[recommended-memory-requirements-for-cns]]
==== Recommended Memory Requirements for Container Native Storage

The recommended memory requirements are 32 GB per {product-title} node hosting
CNS pods.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Follow the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/container-native_storage_for_openshift_container_platform/ch05s02#Planning_Guidelines[planning guidelines] when planning hardware for a CNS storage environment to ensure that
you have enough memory.
====

[[gfs-dedicated-storage-cluster]]
=== Dedicated Storage Cluster

If you have a dedicated Red Hat Gluster Storage cluster available in your
environment, you can configure {product-title}'s Gluster volume plug-in. The
dedicated storage cluster delivers persistent Red Hat Gluster Storage file
storage for containerized applications over the network. The applications access
storage served out from the storage clusters through common storage protocols.

.Architecture - Dedicated Red Hat Gluster Storage Cluster Using the {product-title} Volume Plug-in
image::OpenShift_Containerization_Gluster_412816_0716_JCS_dedicated.png["Architecture - Dedicated Red Hat Gluster Storage Cluster Using the {product-title} Volume Plug-in"]

You can also dynamically provision volumes in a dedicated Red Hat Gluster
Storage cluster that are enabled by Heketi. See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/administration_guide/ch05s02[Managing Volumes Using Heketi] in the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 Administration Guide for more information.

This solution is a conventional deployment where containerized compute
applications run on an {product-title} cluster. The remaining sections in this
topic provide the step-by-step instructions for the dedicated Red Hat Gluster
Storage solution.

This topic presumes some familiarity with {product-title} and GlusterFS:

- See the
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[Persistent Storage] topic for details on the {product-title} PV framework in general.
- See the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/administration_guide/[Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 Administration Guide] for more on GlusterFS.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[[gfs-support-requirements]]
== Support Requirements

The following requirements must be met to create a supported integration of Red
Hat Gluster Storage and {product-title}.

[[gfs-supported-operating-systems]]
=== Supported Operating Systems

The following table lists the supported versions of {product-title} with Red Hat
Gluster Storage Server.

[options="header"]
|===
|Red Hat Gluster Storage | {product-title}

|3.1.3
|3.1 or later
|===

[[gfs-environment-requirements]]
=== Environment Requirements

The environment requirements for {product-title} and Red Hat Gluster Storage are
described in this section.

.Red Hat Gluster Storage
- All installations of Red Hat Gluster Storage must have valid subscriptions to
Red Hat Network channels and Subscription Management repositories.
- Red Hat Gluster Storage installations must adhere to the requirements laid out
in the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/installation_guide/chap-planning_red_hat_storage_installation[Red
Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 Installation Guide].
- Red Hat Gluster Storage installations must be completely up to date with the
latest patches and upgrades. Refer to the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/installation_guide/[Red
Hat Gluster Storage 3.3 Installation Guide] to upgrade to the latest version.
- The versions of {product-title} and Red Hat Gluster Storage integrated must be
compatible, according to the information in
xref:gfs-supported-operating-systems[Supported Operating Systems].
- A fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) must be set for each hypervisor and Red Hat
Gluster Storage server node. Ensure that correct DNS records exist, and that the
FQDN is resolvable via both forward and reverse DNS lookup.

.Red Hat {product-title}
- All installations of {product-title} must have valid subscriptions to Red Hat
Network channels and Subscription Management repositories.
- {product-title} installations must adhere to the requirements laid out in the
xref:../../install_config/index.adoc#install-config-index[Installation
and Configuration] documentation.
- The {product-title} cluster must be up and running.
- A user with *cluster-admin* permissions must be created.
- All {product-title} nodes on RHEL systems must have the *glusterfs-fuse* RPM
installed, which should match the version of Red Hat Gluster Storage server
running in the containers. For more information on installing *glusterfs-fuse*,
see
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_gluster_storage/3.3/html/administration_guide/chap-accessing_data_-_setting_up_clients#sect-Native_Client[Native
Client] in the Red Hat Gluster 3.3 Storage Administration Guide.

[[gfs-provisioning]]
== Provisioning

To provision GlusterFS volumes using the
xref:gfs-dedicated-storage-cluster[dedicated storage cluster solution], the
following are required:

- An existing storage device in your underlying infrastructure.
- A distinct list of servers (IP addresses) in the Gluster cluster, to be defined as endpoints.
- A service, to persist the endpoints (optional).
- An existing Gluster volume to be referenced in the persistent volume object.
- *glusterfs-fuse* installed on each schedulable {product-title} node in your cluster:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ yum install glusterfs-fuse
----

[NOTE]
====
Persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can share volumes
across a single project. While the GlusterFS-specific information contained in a
PV definition could also be defined directly in a pod definition, doing so does
not create the volume as a distinct cluster resource, making the volume more
susceptible to conflicts.
====

[[creating-gluster-endpoints]]
=== Creating Gluster Endpoints

An endpoints definition defines the GlusterFS cluster as `*EndPoints*` and
includes the IP addresses of your Gluster servers. The port value can be any
numeric value within the accepted range of ports. Optionally,
you can create a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[service]
that persists the endpoints.

. Define the following service:
+
.Gluster Service Definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: glusterfs-cluster <1>
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 1
----
<1> This name must be defined in the endpoints definition. If using a service, then
the endpoints name must match the service name.


. Save the service definition to a file, for example *_gluster-service.yaml_*,
then create the service:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f gluster-service.yaml
----


. Verify that the service was created:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get services
NAME                       CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)    SELECTOR        AGE
glusterfs-cluster          172.30.205.34    <none>        1/TCP      <none>          44s
----


. Define the Gluster endpoints:
+
.Gluster Endpoints Definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: glusterfs-cluster <1>
subsets:
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.168.122.221 <2>
    ports:
      - port: 1
  - addresses:
      - ip: 192.168.122.222 <2>
    ports:
      - port: 1 <3>
----
<1> This name must match the service name from step 1.
<2> The `*ip*` values must be the actual IP addresses of a Gluster server, not
fully-qualified host names.
<3> The port number is ignored.


. Save the endpoints definition to a file, for example
*_gluster-endpoints.yaml_*, then create the endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f gluster-endpoints.yaml
endpoints "glusterfs-cluster" created
----


. Verify that the endpoints were created:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get endpoints
NAME                ENDPOINTS                             AGE
docker-registry     10.1.0.3:5000                         4h
glusterfs-cluster   192.168.122.221:1,192.168.122.222:1   11s
kubernetes          172.16.35.3:8443                      4d
----


[[gfs-creating-persistent-volume]]
=== Creating the Persistent Volume

[NOTE]
====
GlusterFS does not support the 'Recycle' reclaim policy.
====

. Next, define the PV in an object definition before creating it in
{product-title}:
+
.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using GlusterFS

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: gluster-default-volume <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 2Gi <2>
  accessModes: <3>
    - ReadWriteMany
  glusterfs: <4>
    endpoints: glusterfs-cluster <5>
    path: myVol1 <6>
    readOnly: false
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain <7>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This is how it is identified via
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> `accessModes` are used as labels to match a PV and a PVC. They currently
do not define any form of access control.
<4> The volume type being used, in this case the *glusterfs*
plug-in.
<5> The endpoints name that defines the Gluster cluster
created in xref:creating-gluster-endpoints[Creating Gluster Endpoints].
<6> The Gluster volume that will be accessed, as shown in the `gluster volume status`
command.
<7> The volume reclaim policy `Retain` indicates that the volume will be
preserved after the pods accessing it terminates. For GlusterFS, the accepted
values include `Retain`, and `Delete`.

[NOTE]
====
Endpoints are name-spaced. Each project accessing the Gluster volume needs its own endpoints.
====

. Save the definition to a file, for example *_gluster-pv.yaml_*, and create
the persistent volume:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f gluster-pv.yaml
----


. Verify that the persistent volume was created:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
gluster-default-volume   <none>    2147483648   RWX           Available                       2s
----

[[gfs-creating-pvc]]
=== Creating the Persistent Volume Claim
Developers request GlusterFS storage by referencing either a PVC or the Gluster
volume plug-in directly in the `*volumes*` section of a pod spec. A PVC exists
only in the user's project and can only be referenced by pods within that
project. Any attempt to access a PV across a project causes the pod to fail.

. Create a PVC that will bind to the new PV:
+
.PVC Object Definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: gluster-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany <1>
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi <2>
----
<1> `*accessModes*` do not enforce security, but rather act as labels to match a PV to a PVC.
<2> This claim will look for PVs offering *1Gi* or greater capacity.


. Save the definition to a file, for example *_gluster-claim.yaml_*, and create
the PVC:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc create -f gluster-claim.yaml
----
+
[NOTE]
====
PVs and PVCs make sharing a volume across a project simpler. The
gluster-specific information contained in the PV definition can also be defined
directly in a pod specification.
====

[[gluster-volume-security]]
== Gluster Volume Security

This section covers Gluster volume security, including matching permissions and
SELinux considerations. Understanding the basics of POSIX permissions, process
UIDs, supplemental groups, and SELinux is presumed.

[NOTE]
====
See the full
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-pod-security-context[Volume
Security] topic before implementing Gluster volumes.
====

As an example, assume that the target Gluster volume, `HadoopVol` is mounted
under *_/mnt/glusterfs/_*, with the following POSIX permissions and SELinux
labels:

[[gfs-mount]]
[source,bash]
----
$ ls -lZ /mnt/glusterfs/
drwxrwx---. yarn hadoop system_u:object_r:fusefs_t:s0    HadoopVol

$ id yarn
uid=592(yarn) gid=590(hadoop) groups=590(hadoop)
----

In order to access the `HadoopVol` volume, containers must match the SELinux
label, and run with a UID of 592 or 590 in their supplemental groups. The
{product-title} GlusterFS plug-in mounts the volume in the container with the
same POSIX ownership and permissions found on the target gluster mount, namely
the owner will be *592* and group ID will be *590*. However, the container is
not run with its effective UID equal to *592*, nor with its GID equal to *590*,
which is the desired behavior. Instead, a container's UID and supplemental
groups are determined by Security Context Constraints (SCCs) and the project
defaults.

[[gfs-supplemental-groups]]
=== Group IDs

Configure Gluster volume access by using supplemental groups, assuming it is not
an option to change permissions on the Gluster mount. Supplemental groups in
{product-title} are used for shared storage, such as GlusterFS. In contrast,
block storage, such as Ceph RBD or iSCSI, use the *fsGroup* SCC strategy and the
*fsGroup* value in the pod's `*securityContext*`.

[NOTE]
====
Use supplemental group IDs instead of xref:gfs-user-ids[user IDs] to gain
access to persistent storage. Supplemental groups are covered further in the
full xref:pod_security_context.adoc#supplemental-groups[Volume Security] topic.
====

The group ID on the xref:gfs-mount[target Gluster mount example above] is 590.
Therefore, a pod can define that group ID using `*supplementalGroups*` under the
pod-level `*securityContext*` definition. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers:
    - name:
    ...
  securityContext: <1>
    supplementalGroups: [590] <2>
----
<1> `*securityContext*` must be defined at the pod level, not under a specific container.
<2> An array of GIDs defined at the pod level.

Assuming there are no custom SCCs that satisfy the pod's requirements, the pod
matches the *restricted* SCC. This SCC has the `*supplementalGroups*` strategy
set to *RunAsAny*, meaning that any supplied group IDs are accepted without
range checking.

As a result, the above pod will pass admissions and can be launched. However, if
group ID range checking is desired, use a custom SCC, as described in
xref:pod_security_context.adoc#scc-supplemental-groups[pod security and custom
SCCs]. A custom SCC can be created to define minimum and maximum group IDs,
enforce group ID range checking, and allow a group ID of *590*.

[[gfs-user-ids]]
=== User IDs

User IDs can be defined in the container image or in the pod definition. The
full  xref:pod_security_context.adoc#user-id[Volume Security] topic covers
controlling storage access based on user IDs, and should be read prior to
setting up NFS persistent storage.

[NOTE]
====
Use xref:gfs-supplemental-groups[supplemental group IDs] instead of user IDs to
gain access to persistent storage.
====

In the xref:gfs-mount[target Gluster mount example above], the container needs
a UID set to *592*, so the following can be added to the pod definition:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  containers: <1>
  - name:
  ...
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 592 <2>
----
<1> Pods contain a `*securtityContext*` specific to each container and a pod-level `*securityContext*`, which applies to all containers defined in the pod.
<2> The UID defined on the Gluster mount.

With the *default* project and the *restricted* SCC, a pod's requested user ID
of *592* will not be allowed, and the pod will fail. This is because:

- The pod requests *592* as its user ID.
- All SCCs available to the pod are examined to see which SCC will allow a user ID of *592*.
- Because all available SCCs use *MustRunAsRange* for their `*runAsUser*`
strategy, UID range checking is required.
- *592* is not included in the SCC or project's user ID range.

Do not modify the predefined SCCs. Insead,
xref:pod_security_context.adoc#scc-runasuser[create a custom SCC] so that
minimum and maximum user IDs are defined, UID range checking is still enforced,
and the UID of *592* will be allowed.

[[selinux]]
=== SELinux

[NOTE]
====
See the full xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#selinuxoptions[Volume Security] topic for
information on controlling storage access in conjunction with using SELinux.
====

By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote Gluster
server.

To enable writing to GlusterFS volumes with SELinux enforcing on each node, run:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_fusefs on
----

[NOTE]
====
The `virt_sandbox_use_fusefs` boolean is defined by the *docker-selinux*
package. If you get an error saying it is not defined, please ensure that this
package is installed.
====

The `-P` option makes the bool persistent between reboots.
