== Overview
The *StorageClass* resource object is used to describe and classify storage that can be requested, as well as
provide a means for passing in parameters for *dynamically provisioned storage* on-demand.  StorageClasses can also serve
as a management mechanism for controlling different levels of storage and access to the storage.  Cluster Administrators (cluster-admin)
or Storage Administrators (storage-admin) need to define and create the StorageClasses that can then be requested by users without the users needing to have
any intimate knowledge about the underlying storage volume sources.

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework enables this functionality and allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

Many storage types are available for use as persistent volumes in
{product-title}. While all of them can be statically provisioned by an
administrator, some types of storage can be created dynamically using the built in provider and plug-in APIs.


[[available-dynamically-provisioned-plug-ins]]
== Available Dynamically Provisioned Plug-ins

{product-title} provides the following _provisioner plug-ins_, which have
generic implementations for dynamic provisioning that use the cluster's
configured provider's API to create new storage resources:

|Storage Type |Provisioner Plug-in Name |Required Configuration| Notes

|OpenStack Cinder
|`kubernetes.io/cinder`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[Configuring for OpenStack]
|

|AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
|`kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[Configuring for AWS]
|For dynamic provisioning when using multiple clusters in different zones, each
node must be tagged with `*Key=KubernetesCluster,Value=clusterid*`.

|GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD)
|`kubernetes.io/gce-pd`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[Configuring for GCE]
|In multi-zone configurations, PVs must be created in the same region/zone as
the master node. Do this by setting the
`*failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region*` and
`*failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone*` PV labels to match the master node.

|GlusterFS

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any chosen provisioner plug-ins, any relevant cloud, host or third-party configurations must also
be set up, per provider required documentation.

[[defining-storage-classes]]
== Defining a StorageClass

StorageClasses are currently a globally scoped object and need to be created by cluster-admins or
storage-admins.
There are currently five plug-ins that are supported. Below sections will
describe the basic Spec definition for a _StorageClass_ and specific examples for each of the supported plug-in types.

[[basic-spec-defintion]]
=== Basic StorageClass Spec Definition

.StorageClass Basic Spec Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass <1>
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1 <2>
metadata:
  name: foo <3>
  annotations: <4>

----
<1> (required) The API object type.
<2> (required) The current apiVersion.
<3> (required) The name of the StorageClass.
<4> (optional) Annotations for the StorageClass
<5> (required) The type of provisioner associated with this storage class.
<6> (optional) The parameters required for the specific provisioner, this will change
from plug-in to plug-in.
====

[[storage-class-annotations]]
=== StorageClass Annotations

- Setting a _StorageClass_ as the cluster wide default _StorageClass_.  This will enable any Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
that does not specify a specific volume to automatically be provisioned via the _default_ StorageClass
----

metadata:
  name: gold
provisioner: kubernetes.io/cinder

  availability: nova <2>

----
<1> VolumeType created in Cinder. Default is empty.

====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: io1 <1>
  zone: us-east-1d <2>
  iopsPerGB: "10" <3>
  encrypted: true <4>
  kmsKeyId: keyvalue <5>

----

<1> io1, gp2, sc1, st1. See AWS docs for details. Default: gp2.
<2> AWS zone. If not specified, a random zone from those where Kubernetes cluster has a node is chosen.
<3> only for io1 volumes. I/O operations per second per GiB. AWS volume plug-in multiplies this with size of requested volume to compute IOPS of the volume and caps it at 20 000 IOPS (maximum supported by AWS, see AWS docs).
<4> denotes whether the EBS volume should be encrypted or not. Valid values are true or false.
<5> (optional) The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key to use when encrypting the volume. If none is supplied but encrypted is true, a key is generated by AWS. link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[See AWS docs for valid ARN value].

parameters:
  endpoint: "glusterfs-cluster"  <1>

  restauthenabled: "true"  <3>
  restuser: "admin"  <4>
  restuserkey: "password"  <5>

----

<1> glusterfs-cluster is the endpoint name which includes GlusterFS trusted pool IP addresses. This parameter is mandatory. We need to also create a service for this endpoint, so that the endpoint will be persisted. This service can be without a selector to tell Kubernetes that the endpoints will be added manually. Please note that, glusterfs plug-in looks for the endpoint in the pod namespace, so it is mandatory that the endpoint and service have to be created in Pod's namespace for successful mount of gluster volumes in the pod.
<2> Gluster REST service/Heketi service url which provision gluster volumes on demand. The general format should be IPaddress:Port and this is a mandatory parameter for GlusterFS dynamic provisioner. If Heketi service is exposed as a routable service in openshift/kubernetes setup, it will have a resolvable fully qualified domain name and heketi service url. link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-gluster-storage/3.1/single/container-native-storage-for-openshift-container-platform/[For additional information and configuration]
<3> Gluster REST service/Heketi user who has access to create volumes in the Gluster Trusted Pool.
<4> Gluster REST service/Heketi user's password which will be used for authentication to the REST server. This parameter is deprecated in favor of secretNamespace + secretName.
<5> Identification of Secret instance that containes user password to use when talking to Gluster REST service. These parameters are optional, empty password will be used when both secretNamespace and secretName are omitted.
