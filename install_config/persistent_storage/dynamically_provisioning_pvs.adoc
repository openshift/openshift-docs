== Overview
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with storage dynamically when
running in a cloud environment. The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

Many storage types are available for use as persistent volumes in
{product-title}. While all of them can be statically provisioned by an
administrator, some types of storage can be created dynamically using an API.
These types of storage can be provisioned in an {product-title} cluster using
the new and experimental dynamic storage feature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
Dynamic provisioning of persistent volumes is currently a Technology Preview
feature, introduced in {product-title} 3.1.1.
endif::[]
This feature is experimental and expected to change in the future as it matures
and feedback is received from users. New ways to provision the cluster are
planned and the means by which one accesses this feature is going to change.
Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

[[enabling-provisioner-plugins]]
== Enabling Provisioner Plug-ins

{product-title} provides the following _provisioner plug-ins_, which have
generic implementations for dynamic provisioning that use the cluster's
configured cloud provider's API to create new storage resources:

[options="header"]
|===

|Storage Type |Provisioner Plug-in Name |Required Cloud Configuration| Notes

|OpenStack Cinder
|`kubernetes.io/cinder`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc#install-config-configuring-openstack[Configuring for OpenStack]
|

|AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)
|`kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_aws.adoc#install-config-configuring-aws[Configuring for AWS]
|For dynamic provisioning when using multiple clusters in different zones, each
node must be tagged with `*Key=KubernetesCluster,Value=clusterid*`.

|GCE Persistent Disk (gcePD)
|`kubernetes.io/gce-pd`
|xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[Configuring for GCE]
|In multi-zone configurations, PVs must be created in the same region/zone as
the master node. Do this by setting the
`*failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region*` and
`*failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone*` PV labels to match the master node.

|===


[IMPORTANT]
====
For any chosen provisioner plug-ins, the relevant cloud configuration must also
be set up, per *Required Cloud Configuration* in the above table.
====

When your {product-title} cluster is configured for EBS, GCE, or Cinder, the
associated provisioner plug-in is implied and automatically enabled. No
additional {product-title} configuration by the cluster administration is
required for dynamic provisioning.

For example, if your {product-title} cluster is configured to run in AWS, the
EBS provisioner plug-in is automatically available for creating
xref:dynamic-pvs-requesting-storage[dynamically provisioned storage requested
by a user].

Future provisioner plug-ins will include the many types of storage a single
provider offers. AWS, for example, has several types of EBS volumes to offer,
each with its own performance characteristics; there is also an NFS-like storage
option. More provisioner plug-ins will be implemented for the supported storage
types available in {product-title}.

[[dynamic-pvs-requesting-storage]]
== Requesting Dynamically Provisioned Storage

Users can request dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class
annotation in their xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent
volume claim]:

.Persistent Volume Claim Requesting Dynamic Storage
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: "PersistentVolumeClaim"
apiVersion: "v1"
metadata:
  name: "claim1"
  annotations:
    volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class: "foo" <1>
spec:
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: "3Gi"
----
<1> The value of the `*volume.alpha.kubernetes.io/storage-class*` annotation is
not meaningful at this time. The presence of the annotation, with any arbitrary
value, triggers provisioning using the single implied
xref:enabling-provisioner-plugins[provisioner plug-in per cloud].

[[volume-owner-info]]
=== Volume Owner Information

For dynamically provisioned storage,
{product-title} defines three key/value pairs,
collectively known as the _volume owner information_,
and arranges for the storage to associate this triplet
with the provisioned volume.
The keys are normally not visible to {product-title} users,
while the values are taken from user-visible PV and PVC objects.

*Keys*

`kubernetes.io/created-for/pv/name`::
Name of the `*PersistentVolume*`.
+
[NOTE]
There is no key for the PV namespace because that has value
`default` and cannot be changed.

`kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/namespace`::
`kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/name`::
Namespace and name, respectively, of the `*PersistentVolumeClaim*`.

*Other Terms for Volume Owner Information*

Each storage type saves the volume owner information
in its own way.
When communicating with the storage administrator,
use these specific terms to avoid confusion:

[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Term for Key/Value Pairs |Storage Type

|tags
|AWS EBS

|metadata
|OpenStack Cinder

|JSON-in-description
|GCE PD
|====

*Using Volume Owner Information*

The main benefit of saving the volume owner information
is to enable storage administrators to recognize volumes
dynamically created by {product-title}.

Example scenarios:

- {product-title} terminates unexpectedly and the dynamically provisioned
AWS EBS
contains useful data that must be recovered.
The {product-title} users provide the storage administrators with a list of
affected projects and their PVCs:
+
[cols="1,1"]
|====
|Project Name |PVC Name

|app-server
|a-pv-01

|
|a-pv-02

|notifications
|n-pv-01
|====
+
The storage administrators search for the orphaned volumes,
matching project names and PVC names to the
`kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/namespace` and
`kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/name` tags, respectively.
They find them and arrange to make them available again for data-recovery efforts.

- The users do not explicitly delete the dynamically provisioned storage
volumes when they are finished with a project.
The storage administrators find the defunct volumes and delete them.
Unlike the preceding scenario, they need match only the project names
to `kubernetes.io/created-for/pvc/namespace`.


[[dynamic-pvs-volume-recycling]]
== Volume Recycling

Volumes created dynamically by a provisioner have their
`*persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy*` set to *Delete*. When a persistent volume
claim is deleted, its backing persistent volume is considered released of its
claim, and that resource can be reclaimed by the cluster. Dynamic provisioning
utilizes the provider's API to delete the volume from the provider and then
removes the persistent volume from the cluster.
