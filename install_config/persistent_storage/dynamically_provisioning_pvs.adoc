== Overview
The _StorageClass_ resource object describes and classifies storage that can be
requested, as well as provides a means for passing parameters for
*dynamically provisioned storage* on demand. _StorageClass_ objects can also serve as
a management mechanism for controlling different levels of storage and access
to the storage. Cluster Administrators (`cluster-admin`) or Storage
Administrators (`storage-admin`) define and create the _StorageClass_ objects
that users can request without needing any intimate knowledge about the
underlying storage volume sources.

The {product-title}
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework enables this functionality and allows administrators to provision a
cluster with persistent storage. The framework also gives users a way to request
those resources without having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

Many storage types are available for use as persistent volumes in
{product-title}. While all of them can be statically provisioned by an
administrator, some types of storage are created dynamically using the
built-in provider and plug-in APIs.

[[available-dynamically-provisioned-plug-ins]]
== Available Dynamically Provisioned Plug-ins

{product-title} provides the following _provisioner plug-ins_, which have
generic implementations for dynamic provisioning that use the cluster's
configured provider's API to create new storage resources:

[[defining-storage-classes]]
== Defining a StorageClass

_StorageClass_ objects are currently a globally scoped object and need to be
created by `cluster-admin` or `storage-admin` users.

[NOTE]
====
For GCE and AWS, a default StorageClass is created during {product-title} installation. You can xref:change-default-storage-class[change the default StorageClass] or delete it.
====

There are currently six
plug-ins that are supported. The following sections describe the basic object
definition for a _StorageClass_ and specific examples for each of the supported
plug-in types.

[[basic-spec-definition]]
=== Basic StorageClass Object Definition

.StorageClass Basic Object Definition
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass <1>
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 <2>
metadata:
  name: foo <3>
  annotations: <4>
     ...
provisioner: kubernetes.io/plug-in-type <5>
parameters: <6>
  param1: value
  ...
  paramN: value

----
<1> (required) The API object type.
<2> (required) The current apiVersion.
<3> (required) The name of the StorageClass.
<4> (optional) Annotations for the StorageClass
<5> (required) The type of provisioner associated with this storage class.
<6> (optional) The parameters required for the specific provisioner, this will change
from plug-in to plug-in.

[[storage-class-annotations]]
=== StorageClass Annotations

To set a _StorageClass_ as the cluster-wide default:
----
   storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
----
This enables any Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) that does not specify a specific
volume to automatically be provisioned through the _default_ StorageClass

[NOTE]
====
Beta annotation `storageclass.beta.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` is still
working. However it will be removed in a future release.
====

To set a _StorageClass_ description:
----
   kubernetes.io/description: My StorageClass Description
----


[[openstack-cinder-spec]]
=== OpenStack Cinder Object Definition

metadata:
  name: gold
provisioner: kubernetes.io/cinder
parameters:
  type: fast  <1>
  availability: nova <2>
  fsType: ext4 <3>
----
<1> Volume type created in Cinder. Default is empty.
<2> Availability Zone. If not specified, volumes are generally round-robined across all active zones where the {product-title} cluster has a node.
<3> File system that is created on dynamically provisioned volumes. This value is
copied to the `fsType` field of dynamically provisioned persistent volumes and
the file system is created when the volume is mounted for the first time. The
default value is `ext4`.

all active zones where the {product-title} cluster has a node. Zone and zones
parameters must not be used at the same time.
<3> Only for *io1* volumes. I/O operations per second per GiB. The AWS volume
plug-in multiplies this with the size of the requested volume to compute IOPS of
the volume. The value cap is 20,000 IOPS, which is the maximum supported by AWS.

is supplied, but `encypted` is set to `true`, then AWS generates a key. See
link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html[AWS
documentation] for a valid ARN value.
<6> File system that is created on dynamically provisioned volumes. This value is
copied to the `fsType` field of dynamically provisioned persistent volumes and
the file system is created when the volume is mounted for the first time. The
default value is `ext4`.

across all active zones where the {product-title} cluster has a node. Zone and
zones parameters must not be used at the same time.
<3> A comma-separated list of GCE zone(s). If no zone is specified, volumes are
generally round-robined across all active zones where the {product-title}
cluster has a node. Zone and zones parameters must not be used at the same time.

=== GlusterFS Object Definition

.glusterfs-storageclass.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow
provisioner: kubernetes.io/glusterfs
parameters:
  resturl: "http://127.0.0.1:8081" <1>
  restuser: "admin" <2>
  secretName: "heketi-secret" <3>
  secretNamespace: "default" <4>
  gidMin: "40000" <5>
  gidMax: "50000" <6>
----
<1> Gluster REST service/Heketi service URL that provisions Gluster
volumes on demand. The general format should be
`{http/https}://{IPaddress}:{Port}`. This is a mandatory parameter for the
GlusterFS dynamic provisioner. If the Heketi service is exposed as a routable
service in the {product-title}, it will have a resolvable fully qualified domain
name and Heketi service URL. For additional information and configuration, See
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-gluster-storage/3.1/single/container-native-storage-for-openshift-container-platform/[Container-Native
Storage for OpenShift Container Platform].
<2> Gluster REST service/Heketi user who has access to create
volumes in the Gluster Trusted Pool.
<3> Identification of a Secret instance that contains a user password to use when
talking to the Gluster REST service. Optional; an empty password will be used
when both `secretNamespace` and `secretName` are omitted. The provided secret
must be of type `"kubernetes.io/glusterfs"`.
<4> The namespace of mentioned `secretName`. Optional; an empty password will be used
when both `secretNamespace` and `secretName` are omitted. The provided secret
must be of type `"kubernetes.io/glusterfs"`.
<5> Optional. The minimum value of GID range for the storage class.
<6> Optional. The maximum value of GID range for the storage class.

When the `gidMin` and `gidMax` values are not specified, the volume is
provisioned with a value between 2000 and 2147483647, which are defaults for
`gidMin` and `gidMax` respectively. If specified, a unique value (GID) in this
range (`gidMin-gidMax`) is used for dynamically provisioned volumes. The GID of
the provisioned volume will be set to this value. It is required to run Heketi
version 3 or later to make use of this feature. This GID is released from the
pool when the subjected volume is deleted. The GID pool is per storage class, if
2 or more storage classes have GID ranges that overlap there will be duplicate
GIDs dispatched by the provisioner.

When the persistent volumes are dynamically provisioned, the Gluster plug-in
automatically creates an endpoint and a headless service of the name
`gluster-dynamic-<claimname>`. When the persistent volume claim is deleted, this
dynamic endpoint and service is deleted automatically.

[[change-default-storage-class]]
== Changing the Default StorageClass
If you are using GCE and AWS, use the following process to change the default StorageClass:

. List the StorageClass:
+

====
----
$ oc get storageclass

NAME                 TYPE
gp2 (default)        kubernetes.io/aws-ebs <1>
standard             kubernetes.io/gce-pd
----
<1> `(default)` denotes the default StorageClass.
====

. Change the value of the annotation `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` to `false` for the default StorageClass:
+

----
$ oc patch storageclass gp2 -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": \
    {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "false"}}}'
----

. Make another StorageClass the default by adding or modifying the annotation as `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class=true`.
+

----
$ oc patch storageclass standard -p '{"metadata": {"annotations": \
    {"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class": "true"}}}'
----

. Verify the changes:
+

----
$ oc get storageclass

NAME                 TYPE
gp2                  kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd
