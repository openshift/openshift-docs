== Overview
{product-title} supports GCE Persistent Disk volumes (gcePD). You can provision
your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage]
using link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/[GCE]. Some familiarity
with Kubernetes and GCE is assumed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before creating persistent volumes using GCE, {product-title} must first be properly
xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[configured for GCE Persistent
Disk].
====

The Kubernetes
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.
GCE Persistent Disk volumes can be
xref:dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[provisioned dynamically].
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single
project or namespace; they can be shared across the {product-title} cluster.
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#persistent-volume-claims[Persistent
volume claims], however, are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.



[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[gce-provisioning]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in {product-title}. After ensuring {product-title} is
xref:../../install_config/configuring_gce.adoc#install-config-configuring-gce[configured for GCE
PersistentDisk], all that is required for {product-title} and GCE is an GCE
Persistent Disk volume ID and the `*PersistentVolume*` API.

[[gce-creating-persistent-volume]]

=== Creating the Persistent Volume

You must define your persistent volume in an object definition before creating
it in {product-title}:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using GCE
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  gcePersistentDisk: <3>
    fsType: "ext4" <4>
    pdName: "pd-disk-1" <5>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This will be how it is identified via
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> This defines the volume type being used, in this case the *gcePersistentDisk* plug-in.
<4> File system type to mount.
<5> This is the GCE Persistent Disk volume that will be used.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `*fstype*` parameter after the volume has been
formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.
====

Save your definition to a file, for example *_gce-pv.yaml_*, and create the
persistent volume:

====
----
# oc create -f gce-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----
====

Verify that the persistent volume was created:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWO           Available                       2s
----
====

Users can then xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[request storage
using persistent volume claims], which can now utilize your new persistent
volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volume claims only exist in the user's namespace and can only be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
persistent volume from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
====

[[volume-format-gce]]

=== Volume Format
Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks
that it contains a file system as specified by the `*fsType*` parameter in the
persistent volume definition. If the device is not formatted with the file
system, all data from the device is erased and the device is automatically
formatted with the given file system.

This allows using unformatted GCE volumes as persistent volumes, because
{product-title} formats them before the first use.
