To access GlusterFS volumes, the `mount.glusterfs` command must be available on
all schedulable nodes. For RPM-based systems, the *glusterfs-fuse* package must
be installed:

----
# yum install glusterfs-fuse
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This package comes installed on every RHEL system. However, it is recommended to
update to the latest available version from {gluster}. To do this, the following
RPM repository must be enabled:

----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
# subscription-manager refresh
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----
endif::[]

If *glusterfs-fuse* is already installed on the nodes, ensure that the latest
version is installed:

----
# yum update glusterfs-fuse
----

From the master, perform the following tasks to prepare the Gluster nodes:

. Distribute the SSH key to the Gluster Storage nodes.

----
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub kvm-03-guest13.rhts.eng.bos.redhat.com

----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils yum-utils iptables-services bridge-utils bash-completion kexec-tools sos psacct
# yum update
# reboot
----

. If you are using the RPM-based installer, install the following package:
+
----
# yum install openshift-ansible
----

. Install Docker 1.13:

# subscription-manager repos --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms"
# yum install docker-1.13.1
# rpm -V docker-1.13.1
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
# systemctl is-active docker
