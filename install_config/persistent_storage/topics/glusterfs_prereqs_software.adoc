To access GlusterFS volumes, the `mount.glusterfs` command must be available on
all schedulable nodes. For RPM-based systems, the *glusterfs-fuse* package must
be installed:

----
# yum install glusterfs-fuse
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This package comes installed on every RHEL system. However, it is recommended to
update to the latest available version from {gluster}. To do this, the following
RPM repository must be enabled:

----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-7-server-rpms
----
endif::[]

If *glusterfs-fuse* is already installed on the nodes, ensure that the latest
version is installed:

----
# yum update glusterfs-fuse
----
