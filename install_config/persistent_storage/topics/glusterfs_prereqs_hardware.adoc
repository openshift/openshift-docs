Any nodes used in a {gluster-native} or {gluster-external} cluster are
considered storage nodes. Storage nodes can be grouped into distinct cluster
groups, though a single node can not be in multiple groups. For each group of
storage nodes:

- A minimum of three storage nodes per group is required.
- Each storage node must have a minimum of 8 GB of RAM. This is to allow running
the {gluster} pods, as well as other applications and the underlying operating
system.
  ** Each GlusterFS volume also consumes memory on every storage node in its
  storage cluster, which is about 30 MB. The total amount of RAM should be
  determined based on how many concurrent volumes are desired or anticipated.
- Each storage node must have at least one raw block device with no present data
or metadata. These block devices will be used in their entirety for GlusterFS
storage. Make sure the following are not present:
  ** Partition tables (GPT or MSDOS)
  ** Filesystems or residual filesystem signatures
  ** LVM2 signatures of former Volume Groups and Logical Volumes
  ** LVM2 metadata of LVM2 physical volumes

If in doubt, `wipefs -a <device>` should clear any of the above.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is recommended to plan for two clusters: one dedicated to storage
for infrastructure applications (such as an OpenShift Container Registry) and
one dedicated to storage for general applications. This would require a total
of six storage nodes. This recommendation is made to avoid potential impacts on
performance in I/O and volume creation.
