For {gluster-native}, an {product-title} install comes with a
playbook to uninstall all resources and artifacts from the cluster. To use the playbook,
provide the original inventory file that was used to install the target instance
of {gluster-native}, change to the playbook directory, and run the following playbook:

----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml
----

In addition, the playbook supports the use of a variable called
`openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe` which, when enabled, destroys any data on the
block devices that were used for {gluster} backend storage. To use the
`openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe` variable, change to the playbook directory
and run the following playbook:

----
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible
$ ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> -e \
  "openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe=true" \
  playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml
----

[WARNING]
====
This procedure destroys data. Proceed with caution.
