For {gluster-native}, an {product-title} install comes with a
playbook to uninstall all resources and artifacts from the cluster. To use the playbook,
provide the original inventory file that was used to install the target instance
of {gluster-native} and run the following playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml
----

In addition, the playbook supports the use of a variable called
`openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe` which, when enabled, destroys any data on the
block devices that were used for {gluster} backend storage. To use the
`openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe` variable:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <path_to_inventory_file> -e
"openshift_storage_glusterfs_wipe=true"
/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-glusterfs/uninstall.yml 
----

[WARNING]
====
This procedure destroys data. Proceed with caution.
