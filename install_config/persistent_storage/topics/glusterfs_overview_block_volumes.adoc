gluster-block volumes are volumes that can be mounted over iSCSI. This is
done by creating a file on an existing GlusterFS volume and then presenting
that file as a block device via an iSCSI target. Such GlusterFS volumes are
called block-hosting volumes.

gluster-block volumes present a sort of trade-off. Being consumed as iSCSI
targets, gluster-block volumes can only be mounted by one node/client at a time
which is in contrast to GlusterFS volumes which can be mounted by multiple
nodes/clients. Being files on the backend, however, allows for operations which
are typically costly on GlusterFS volumes (e.g. metadata lookups) to be
converted to ones which are typically much faster on GlusterFS volumes (e.g.
reads and writes). This leads to potentially substantial performance
improvements for certain workloads.

====
At this time, it is recommended to only use gluster-block volumes for OpenShift
Logging and OpenShift Metrics storage.
