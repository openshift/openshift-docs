Every GlusterFS cluster must be sized based on the needs of the anticipated
applications that will use its storage. For example, there are sizing guides
available for both
xref:../../install_config/aggregate_logging_sizing.adoc#install-config-aggregate-logging-sizing[OpenShift Logging]
and
xref:../../install_config/cluster_metrics.adoc#capacity-planning-for-openshift-metrics[OpenShift Metrics].

Some additional things to consider are:

* For each {gluster-native} or {gluster-external} cluster, the default behavior
is to create GlusterFS volumes with three-way replication. As such, the total
storage to plan for should be the desired capacity times three.
** As an example, each heketi instance creates a `heketidbstorage` volume that is 2
GB in size, requiring a total of 6 GB of raw storage across three nodes in the
storage cluster. This capacity is always required and should be taken into
consideration for sizing calculations.
** Applications like an integrated OpenShift Container Registry share a single
GlusterFS volume across multiple instances of the application.
* gluster-block volumes require the presence of a GlusterFS block-hosting
volume with enough capacity to hold the full size of any given block volume's
capacity.
** By default, if no such block-hosting volume exists, one will be automatically
created at a set size. The default for this size is 100 GB. If there is not
enough space in the cluster to create the new block-hosting volume, the creation
of the block volume will fail. Both the auto-create behavior and the
auto-created volume size are configurable.
** Applications with multiple instances that use gluster-block volumes, such as
OpenShift Logging and OpenShift Metrics, will use one volume per instance.
* The Gluster S3 service binds to two GlusterFS volumes. In a
xref:../../install/index.adoc#install-planning[default cluster installation],
these volumes are 1 GB each, consuming a total of 6 GB of raw storage.
