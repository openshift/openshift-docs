The Gluster S3 service allows user applications to access GlusterFS storage via
an S3 interface. The service binds to two GlusterFS volumes, one for object
data and one for object metadata, and translates incoming S3 REST requests into
filesystem operations on the volumes. It is recommended to run the service as a
pod inside {product-title}.
