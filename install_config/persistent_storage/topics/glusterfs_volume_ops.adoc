Volume operations, such as create and delete, can be impacted by a variety of
environmental circumstances and can in turn affect applications as well.

* If the application pod requests a dynamically provisioned GlusterFS
persistent volume claim (PVC), then extra time might have to be considered for
the volume to be created and bound to the corresponding PVC. This effects the
startup time for an application pod.

[NOTE]
====
Creation time of GlusterFS volumes scales linearly depending on the number of
volumes. As an example, given 100 volumes in a cluster using recommended
hardware specifications, each volume took approximately 6 seconds to be created,
allocated, and bound to a pod.
====
* When a PVC is deleted, that action will trigger the deletion of the
underlying GlusterFS volume. While PVCs will disappear immediately from the
`oc get pvc` output, this does not mean the volume has been fully deleted. A
GlusterFS volume can only be considered deleted when it does not show up in the
command-line outputs for `heketi-cli volume list` and `gluster volume list`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The time to delete the GlusterFS volume and recycle its storage depends on and
scales linearly with the number of active GlusterFS volumes. While pending
volume deletes do not affect running applications, storage administrators should
be aware of and be able to estimate how long they will take, especially when
tuning resource consumption at scale.
