{gluster} volumes present POSIX-compliant file systems. As such, access
permissions can be managed using standard command-line tools such as *chmod*
and *chown*.

For {gluster-native} and {gluster-external}, it is also possible to specify a
group ID that will own the root of the volume at volume creation time. For
static provisioning, this is specified as part of the *heketi-cli* volume
creation command:

[source,bash]
----
$ heketi-cli volume create --size=100 --gid=10001000
----

[WARNING]
====
The PersistentVolume that will be associated with this volume must be annotated
with the group ID so that pods consuming the PersistentVolume can have access
to the file system. This annotation takes the form of:

---
pv.beta.kubernetes.io/gid: "<GID>"
---
====

For dynamic provisioning, the provisioner automatically generates and applies a
group ID. It is possible to control the range from which this group ID is
selected using the *gidMin* and *gidMax* StorageClass parameters (see
xref:provisioning-dynamic[Dynamic Provisioning]). The provisioner also takes
care of annotating the generated PersistentVolume with the group ID.
