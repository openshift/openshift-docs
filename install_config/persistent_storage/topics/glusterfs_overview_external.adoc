With {gluster-external}, {gluster} runs on its own dedicated nodes and is
managed by an instance of link:https://github.com/heketi/heketi[heketi], the
GlusterFS volume management REST service. This heketi service must run as
containerized, and not as standalone. Containerization allows for an easy mechanism to
provide high-availability to the service. This documentation focuses on the containerized heketi configuration.
