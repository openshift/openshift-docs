With {gluster-external}, {gluster} runs on its own dedicated nodes and is
managed by an instance of link:https://github.com/heketi/heketi[heketi], the
GlusterFS volume management REST service. This heketi service can run either
standalone or containerized. Containerization allows for an easy mechanism to
provide high-availability to the service. This documentation will focus on the
configuration where heketi is containerized.
