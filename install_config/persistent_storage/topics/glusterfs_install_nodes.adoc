For {gluster-external}, each {gluster} node must have the appropriate system
configurations (e.g. firewall ports, kernel modules) and the {gluster} services
must be running. The services should not be further configured, and should not
have formed a Trusted Storage Pool.

The installation of {gluster} nodes is beyond the scope of this documentation.
