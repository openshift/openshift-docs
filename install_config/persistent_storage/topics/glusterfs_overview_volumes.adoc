GlusterFS volumes present a POSIX-compliant filesystem and are comprised of one
or more "bricks" across one or more nodes in their cluster. A brick is just a
directory on a given storage node and is typically the mount point for a block
storage device. GlusterFS handles distribution and replication of files across
a given volume's bricks per that volume's configuration.

It is recommended to use heketi for most common volume management operations
such as create, delete, and resize. {product-title} expects heketi to be
present when using the GlusterFS provisioner. heketi by default will create
volumes that are three-ray replica, that is volumes where each file has three
copies across three different nodes. As such it is recommended that any
{gluster} clusters which will be used by heketi have at least three nodes
available.

There are many features available for GlusterFS volumes, but they are beyond
the scope of this documentation.
