By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote {gluster}
server. To enable writing to {gluster} volumes with SELinux on, run the
following on each node running GlusterFS:

[source,bash]
----
$ sudo setsebool -P virt_sandbox_use_fusefs on <1>
$ sudo setsebool -P virt_use_fusefs on
----
<1> The `-P` option makes the boolean persistent between reboots. 

[NOTE]
====
The `virt_sandbox_use_fusefs` boolean is defined by the *docker-selinux*
package. If you get an error saying it is not defined, ensure that this
package is installed.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you use Atomic Host, the SELinux booleans are cleared when you upgrade Atomic Host. When you upgrade Atomic Host, you must set these boolean values again.
