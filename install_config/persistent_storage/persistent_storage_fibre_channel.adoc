== Overview
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] using
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch-fibrechanel.html[Fibre Channel].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Fibre Channel is assumed.

The Kubernetes xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[provisioning-fibre]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in {product-title}. All that is required for Fibre Channel persistent
storage is the *targetWWNs* (array of Fibre Channel target's World Wide
Names), a valid *LUN* number, filesystem type, and the `*PersistentVolume*`
API. Persistent volume and a LUN have one-to-one mapping between them.

[NOTE]
====
Fibre Channel does not support the 'Recycle' reclaim policy.

.Persistent Volumes Object Definition

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv0001
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  fc:
    targetWWNs: ['500a0981891b8dc5', '500a0981991b8dc5'] <1>
    lun: 2
    fsType: ext4
----
<1> Fibre Channel WWNs are identified as `/dev/disk/by-path/pci-<IDENTIFIER>-fc-0x<WWN>-lun-<LUN#>`, but you do not need to provide any part of the path leading up to the `WWN`, including the `0x`, and anything after, including the `-` (hyphen).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `*fstype*` parameter after the volume has been
formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.
====

[[enforcing-disk-quotas-fibre]]

=== Enforcing Disk Quotas
Use LUN partitions to enforce disk quotas and size constraints. Each LUN is one persistent volume. Kubernetes enforces
unique names for persistent volumes.

Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

[[volume-security-fibre]]

=== Fibre Channel Volume Security
Users request storage with a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*`. This claim only lives in
the user's namespace and can only be referenced by a pod within that same
namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a namespace causes
the pod to fail.

Each Fibre Channel LUN must be accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
