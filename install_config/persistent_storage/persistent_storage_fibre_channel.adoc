== Overview
You can provision your {product-title} cluster with
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent storage] using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/ch25.html[Fibre Channel].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and Fibre Channel is assumed.

The Kubernetes xref:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.adoc#dev-guide-persistent-volumes[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[provisioning-fibre]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in {product-title}. All that is required for Fibre Channel persistent storage is the targetWWNs (array of Fibre Channel target's World Wide Names),
a valid LUN number, and filesystem type, and the `*PersistentVolume*` API. Note, the number of LUNs must correspond to the number of Persistent Volumes that
are created. In the example below, we have LUN as 2, therefore we have created two Persistent Volume definitions.

[NOTE]
====
Fibre Channel does not support the 'Recycle' reclaim policy.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changing the value of the `*fstype*` parameter after the volume has been
formatted and provisioned can result in data loss and pod failure.

[[enforcing-disk-quotas-fibre]]

=== Enforcing Disk Quotas
Use LUN partitions to enforce disk quotas and size constraints. Each LUN is one persistent volume. Kubernetes enforces
unique names for persistent volumes.

Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

[[volume-security-fibre]]

=== Fibre Channel Volume Security
Users request storage with a `*PersistentVolumeClaim*`. This claim only lives in
the user's namespace and can only be referenced by a pod within that same
namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a namespace causes
the pod to fail.

Each Fibre Channel LUN must be accessible by all nodes in the cluster.
