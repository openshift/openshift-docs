The Openshift
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage]
framework allows an OpenShift cluster to provide access to persistent storage
via shared or block networked storage. This can be setup after
completing the initial OpenShift installation, and provides developers the ability
to request storage resources without requiring knowledge of the underlying
infrastructure.

These topics show how to configure persistent volumes in OpenShift using the
following supported volume plug-ins:

- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_nfs.html[NFS]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_glusterfs.html[GlusterFS]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_cinder.html[OpenStack
Cinder]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_ceph_rbd.html[Ceph
RBD]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_aws.html[AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_gce.html[GCE
Persistent Disk]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_iscsi.html[iSCSI]
- link:../../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_fibre_channel.html[Fibre Channel]

Controlling access to these persistent volumes is covered in the
link:pod_security_context.html[volume security]
document, with security aspects unique to specific volume types described in their
respective links above.
