== Overview
{product-title} clusters can be provisioned with xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] by using local volumes. Local persistent volume allows you to access local storage devices such as a disk, partition or directory by using the standard PVC interface.

Local volumes can be used without manually scheduling pods to nodes, because the system is aware of the volumeâ€™s node constraints. However, local volumes are still subject to the availability of the underlying node and are not suitable for all applications.

[NOTE]
====
Local volumes is an alpha feature and may change in a future release of {product-title}. See xref:local-volume-alpha-feature-status[Feature Status(Local Volume)] section for details on known issues and workarounds.
====

[WARNING]
====
Local volumes can only be used as a statically created Persistent Volume.

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as a volume in {product-title}. Ensure that {product-title} is configured for xref:../../install_config/configuring_local.adoc#install-config-configuring-local[Local Volumes], before using the `PersistentVolume` API.

== Feature Status

*What Works:*

* Creating a PV by specifying a directory with node affinity.
* A Pod using the PVC that is bound to the previously mentioned PV always get scheduled to that node.
* External static provisioner daemonset that discovers local directories, creates, cleans up and deletes PVs.

*What does not work:*

* Multiple local PVCs in a single pod.
* PVC binding does not consider pod scheduling requirements and may make sub-optimal or incorrect decisions.
** Workarounds:
*** Run those pods first, which requires local volume.
*** Give the pods high priority.
*** Run a workaround controller that unbinds PVCs for pods that are stuck pending.
* If mounts are added after the external provisioner is started, then external provisioner cannot detect the correct capcity of mounts.
** Workarounds:
*** Before adding any new mount points, first stop the daemonset, add the new mount points, and then start the daemonset.
* `fsgroup` conflict occurs if multiple pods using the same PVC specify different `fsgroup` 's.
