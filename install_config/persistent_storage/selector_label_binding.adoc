== Overview
This guide provides the steps necessary to enable binding of persistent volume
claims (PVCs) to persistent volumes (PVs) via *selector* and *label* attributes.
By implementing selectors and labels, regular users are able to target
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[provisioned
storage] by identifiers defined by a cluster administrator.

[[selector-label-volume-motivation]]
== Motivation
In cases of statically provisioned storage, developers seeking persistent
storage are required to know a handful of identifying attributes of a PV in order
to deploy and bind a PVC. This creates several problematic situations. Regular
users might have to contact a cluster administrator to either deploy the PVC or
provide the PV values. PV attributes alone do not convey the intended use of the
storage volumes, nor do they provide methods by which volumes can be grouped.

Selector and label attributes can be used to abstract away PV details from the
user while providing cluster administrators with a way of identifying volumes by a
descriptive and customizable tag. Through the selector-label method of binding,
users are only required to know which labels are defined by the administrator.

[NOTE]
====
The selector-label feature is currently only available for _statically_ provisioned
storage and is currently not implemented for storage provisioned dynamically.

[[selector-label-volume-deployment]]
== Deployment
This section reviews how to define and deploy PVCs.

[[selector-label-volume-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

. A running {product-title} 3.3+ cluster
. A volume provided by a supported
xref:./index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[storage provider]
. A user with a cluster-admin role binding

[[selector-label-volume-define]]
=== Define the Persistent Volume and Claim

. As the *cluster-admin* user, define the PV. For this example, we will
be using a
xref:./persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-glusterfs[GlusterFS]
volume.
See the appropriate
xref:./index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[storage provider]
for your provider's configuration.

a PV is available.

  name: gluster-claim
spec:

  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
  selector: <1>
    matchLabels: <2>
      volume-type: ssd
      aws-availability-zone: us-east-1
----
<1> Begin *selectors* section.
<2> List all labels by which the user is requesting storage. Must match _all_
labels of targeted PV.
====

[[selector-label-volume-bind]]
=== Optional: Bind a PVC to a specific PV

A PVC that does not specify a PV name or selector will match any PV.

To bind a PVC to a specific PV as a cluster administrator:

* Use `pvc.spec.volumeName` if you know the PV name.
* Use `pvc.spec.selector` if you know the PV labels.
+
By specifying a selector, the PVC requires the PV to have specific labels.


[[selector-label-volume-reserve]]
=== Optional: Reserve a PV to a specific PVC

To reserve a PV for specific tasks, you have two options: create a specific storage class, or pre-bind the PV to your PVC.

. Request a specific storage class for the PV by specifying the storage classâ€™s name.
+
The following resource shows the required values that you use to configure a StorageClass. This example uses the AWS ElasticBlockStore (EBS) object definition.

.StorageClass definition for EBS
====
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kafka
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
...
----
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If necessary in a multi-tenant environment, use a quota definition to reserve the storage class and PV(s) only to a specific namespace.
====

. Pre-bind the PV to your PVC using the PVC namespace and name. A PV defined as such will bind only to the specified PVC and to nothing else, as shown in the following example:
+
.claimRef in PV definition
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: mktg-ops--kafka--kafka-broker01
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 15Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  claimRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
      name: kafka-broker01
      namespace: default
...
----
====

[[selector-label-volume-deploy]]
=== Deploy the Persistent Volume and Claim

As the *cluster-admin* user, create the persistent volume:

.Create the Persistent Volume
====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pv.yaml
persistentVolume "gluster-volume" created

# oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
gluster-volume            map[]    2147483648   RWX           Available                       2s
----
====

Once the PV is created, any user whose selectors match _all_ its labels can
create their PVC.

.Create the Persistent Volume Claim
====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pvc.yaml
persistentVolumeClaim "gluster-claim" created
# oc get pvc
NAME          LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME
gluster-claim           Bound     gluster-volume
----
====
