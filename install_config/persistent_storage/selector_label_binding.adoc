== Overview
This guide provides the steps necessary to enable binding of persistent volume
claims (PVCs) to persistent volumes (PVs) via *selector* and *label* attributes.
By implementing selectors and labels, regular users are able to target
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[provisioned
storage] by identifiers defined by a cluster administrator.

[[selector-label-volume-motivation]]
== Motivation
In cases of statically provisioned storage, developers seeking persistent
storage are required to know a handful identifying attributes of a PV in order
to deploy and bind a PVC. This creates several problematic situations. Regular
users might have to contact a cluster administrator to either deploy the PVC or
provide the PV values. PV attributes alone do not convey the intended use of the
storage volumes, nor do they provide methods by which volumes can be grouped.

Selector and label attributes can be used to abstract away PV details from the
user while providing cluster administrators a way of identifying volumes by a
descriptive and customizable tag. Through the selector-label method of binding,
users are only required to know which labels are defined by the administrator.

[NOTE]
====
The selector-label feature is currently only available for _statically_ provisioned
storage and is currently not implemented for storage provisioned dynamically.

[[selector-label-volume-deployment]]
== Deployment
This section reviews how to define and deploy PVCs.

[[selector-label-volume-prereqs]]
=== Prerequisites

. A running {product-title} 3.3+ cluster
. A volume provided by a supported
xref:./index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[storage provider]
. A user with a cluster-admin role binding

[[selector-label-volume-define]]
=== Define the Persistent Volume and Claim

. As the *cluser-admin* user, define the PV. For this example, we will
be using a
xref:./persistent_storage_glusterfs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-glusterfs[GlusterFS]
volume.
See the appropriate
xref:../index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[storage provider]
for your provider's configuration.

.Persistent Volume with Labels
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: gluster-volume
  labels: <1>
    volume-type: ssd
    aws-availability-zone: us-east-1
spec:

----
<1> A PVC whose selectors match _all_ of a PV's labels will be bound, assuming
a PV is available.

.Persistent Volume Claim with Selectors
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: gluster-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
     requests:
       storage: 1Gi
  selector: <1>
    matchLabels: <2>
      volume-type: ssd
      aws-availability-zone: us-east-1
----
<1> Begin *selectors* section.
<2> List all labels by which the user is requesting storage. Must match _all_
labels of targeted PV.
====

[[selector-label-volume-deploy]]
=== Deploy the Persistent Volume and Claim

As the *cluster-admin* user, create the persistent volume:

.Create the Persistent Volume
====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pv.yaml
persistentVolume "gluster-volume" created

# oc get pv
NAME                     LABELS    CAPACITY     ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
gluster-volume            map[]    2147483648   RWX           Available                       2s
----
====

Once the PV is created, any user whose selectors match _all_ its labels can
create their PVC.

.Create the Persistent Volume Claim
====
----
# oc create -f gluster-pvc.yaml
persistentVolumeClaim "gluster-claim" created
# oc get pvc
NAME          LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME
gluster-claim           Bound     gluster-volume
----
