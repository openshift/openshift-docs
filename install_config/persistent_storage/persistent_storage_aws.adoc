== Overview
OpenShift supports AWS Elastic Block Store volumes (EBS). You can provision your OpenShift cluster with
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[AWS EC2].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and AWS is assumed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before creating persistent volumes using AWS, OpenShift must first be properly
link:../../install_config/configuring_aws.html[configured for AWS
ElasticBlockStore].
====

The Kubernetes
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.
AWS Elastic Block Store volumes can be
link:dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html[provisioned dynamically].
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single
project or namespace; they can be shared across the OpenShift cluster.
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#persistent-volume-claims[Persistent
volume claims], however, are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.



[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
====

[[aws-provisioning]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in OpenShift. After ensuring OpenShift is
link:../../install_config/configuring_aws.html[configured for AWS Elastic Block
Store], all that is required for OpenShift and AWS is an AWS EBS volume ID and
the `*PersistentVolume*` API.

=== Creating the Persistent Volume

You must define your persistent volume in an object definition before creating
it in OpenShift:

.Persistent Volume Object Definition Using AWS
====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "PersistentVolume"
metadata:
  name: "pv0001" <1>
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: "5Gi" <2>
  accessModes:
    - "ReadWriteOnce"
  awsElasticBlockStore: <3>
    fsType: "ext4" <4>
    volumeID: "vol-f37a03aa" <5>
----
<1> The name of the volume. This will be how it is identified via
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent volume
claims] or from pods.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> This defines the volume type being used, in this case the *awsElasticBlockStore* plug-in.
<4> File system type to mount.
<5> This is the AWS volume that will be used.
====

Save your definition to a file, for example *_aws-pv.yaml_*, and create the
persistent volume:

====
----
# oc create -f aws-pv.yaml
persistentvolume "pv0001" created
----
====

Verify that the persistent volume was created:

====
----
# oc get pv
NAME      LABELS    CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   STATUS      CLAIM     REASON    AGE
pv0001    <none>    5Gi        RWO           Available                       2s
----
====

Users can then link:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[request storage
using persistent volume claims], which can now utilize your new persistent
volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Persistent volume claims only exist in the user's namespace and can only be
referenced by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a
persistent volume from a different namespace causes the pod to fail.
====

[[volume-format-aws]]

=== Volume Format
Before OpenShift mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks that
it contains a file system as specified by the `*fsType*` parameter in the
persistent volume definition. If the device is not formatted with the file
system, all data from the device is erased and the device is automatically
formatted with the given file system.

This allows using unformatted AWS volumes as persistent volumes, as OpenShift
will format them before the first use. However, it can result in data loss if
value of the `*fsType*` parameter is changed after the volume was already
formatted and provisioned with data.
