== Overview

{product-title} has built-in
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[volume
plug-ins] to use different storage technologies. To use storage from a
back-end that does not have a built-in plug-in, you can extend {product-title}
through FlexVolume drivers and provide
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent
storage] to applications.

[[flex-volume-drivers]]
== FlexVolume drivers

A FlexVolume driver is an executable file that resides in a well-defined
directory on all machines in the cluster, both masters and nodes.
{product-title} calls the FlexVolume driver whenever it needs to attach, detach, mount, or unmount
a volume represented by a `PersistentVolume` with `flexVolume` as the source.

The first command-line argument of the driver is always an operation name. Other
parameters are specific to each operation. Most of the operations take a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) string as a parameter. This parameter is a
complete JSON string, and not the name of a file with the JSON data.

The FlexVolume driver contains:

* All `flexVolume.options`.
* Some options from `flexVolume` prefixed by `kubernetes.io/`, such as `fsType` and `readwrite`.
* The content of the referenced secret, if specified, prefixed by `kubernetes.io/secret/`.

.FlexVolume driver JSON input example

[source,json]
----
{
	"fooServer": "192.168.0.1:1234", <1>
        "fooVolumeName": "bar",
	"kubernetes.io/fsType": "ext4", <2>
	"kubernetes.io/readwrite": "ro", <3>
	"kubernetes.io/secret/<key name>": "<key value>", <4>
	"kubernetes.io/secret/<another key name>": "<another key value>",
}
----
<1> All options from `flexVolume.options`.
<2> The value of `flexVolume.fsType`.
<3> `ro`/`rw` based on `flexVolume.readOnly`.
<4> All keys and their values from the secret referenced by `flexVolume.secretRef`.

{product-title} expects JSON data on standard output of the driver. When not
specified, the output describes the result of the operation.

.FlexVolume Driver Default Output

[source,json]
----
{
	"status": "<Success/Failure/Not supported>",
	"message": "<Reason for success/failure>"
}
----

Exit code of the driver should be `0` for success and `1` for error.

Operations should be idempotent, which means that the attachment of an already
attached volume or the mounting of an already mounted volume should result in a
successful operation.

The FlexVolume driver can work in two modes:

* xref:flex-volume-drivers-with-master-initiated-attach-detach[with the master-initated attach/detach] operation, or
* xref:flex-volume-drivers-without-master-initiated-attach-detach[without the master-initated attach/detach] operation.

The `attach/detach` operation is used by the {product-title} master to attach a
volume to a node and to detach it from a node. This is useful when a node
becomes unresponsive for any reason. Then, the master can kill all pods on the
node, detach all volumes from it, and attach the volumes to other nodes to
resume the applications while the original node is still not reachable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Not all storage back-end supports master-initiated detachment of a volume from another machine.

[[flex-volume-drivers-with-master-initiated-attach-detach]]
=== FlexVolume drivers with master-initiated attach/detach

A FlexVolume driver that supports master-controlled attach/detach must implement
the following operations:

`init`::
Initializes the driver. It is called during initialization of masters and nodes.

* Arguments: none
* Executed on: master, node
* Expected output: default JSON


`getvolumename`::
Returns the unique name of the volume. This name must be consistent among all
masters and nodes, because it is used in subsequent `detach` call as
`<volume-name>`. Any `/` characters in the `<volume-name>` are automatically
replaced by `~`.

* Arguments: `<json>`
* Executed on: master, node
* Expected output: default JSON + `volumeName`:
+
[source,json]
----
{
	"status": "Success",
	"message": "",
	"volumeName": "foo-volume-bar" <1>
}
----
<1> The unique name of the volume in storage back-end `foo`.

`attach`::
Attaches a volume represented by the JSON to a given node. This operation should
return the name of the device on the node if it is known, that is, if it has been
assigned by the storage back-end before it runs. If the device is not known,
the device must be found on the node by the subsequent `waitforattach`
operation.

* Arguments: `<json>` `<node-name>`
* Executed on: master
* Expected output: default JSON + `device`, if known:
+
[source,json]
----
{
	"status": "Success",
	"message": "",
	"device": "/dev/xvda" <1>
}
----
<1> The name of the device on the node, if known.

`waitforattach`::
Waits until a volume is fully attached to a node and its device emerges.
If the previous `attach` operation has returned `<device-name>`, it is provided
as an input parameter. Otherwise, `<device-name>` is empty and the operation must find the device on the node.

* Arguments: `<device-name>` `<json>`
* Executed on: node
* Expected output: default JSON + `device`
+
[source,json]
----
{
	"status": "Success",
	"message": "",
	"device": "/dev/xvda" <1>
}
----
<1> The name of the device on the node.

`detach`::
Detaches the given volume from a node. `<volume-name>` is the name of the device
returned by the `getvolumename` operation. Any `/` characters in the
`<volume-name>` are automatically replaced by `~`.

* Arguments: `<volume-name>` `<node-name>`
* Executed on: master
* Expected output: default JSON

`isattached`::
Checks that a volume is attached to a node.

* Arguments: `<json>` `<node-name>`
* Executed on: master
* Expected output: default JSON + `attached`
+
[source,json]
----
{
	"status": "Success",
	"message": "",
	"attached": true <1>
}
----
<1> The status of attachment of the volume to the node.

`mountdevice`::
Mounts a volume's device to a directory. `<device-name>` is name of the
device as returned by the previous `waitforattach` operation.

* Arguments: `<mount-dir>` `<device-name>` `<json>`
* Executed on: node
* Expected output: default JSON

`unmountdevice`::
Unmounts a volume's device from a directory.

* Arguments: `<mount-dir>`
* Executed on: node

All other operations should return JSON with `{"status": "Not supported"}`
and exit code `1`.

[NOTE]
====
Master-initiated attach/detach operations are enabled by default.
When not enabled, the attach/detach operations are initiated by a node where the
volume should be attached to or detached from. Syntax and all parameters of
FlexVolume driver invocations are the same in both cases.
====

[[flex-volume-drivers-without-master-initiated-attach-detach]]
=== FlexVolume drivers without master-initiated attach/detach

FlexVolume drivers that do not support master-controlled attach/detach are
executed only on the node and must implement these operations:

`init`::
Initializes the driver. It is called during initialization of all nodes.

* Arguments: none
* Executed on: node
* Expected output: default JSON

`mount`::
Mounts a volume to directory. This can include anything that is necessary
to mount the volume, including attaching the volume to the node, finding the
its device, and then mounting the device.

* Arguments: `<mount-dir>` `<json>`
* Executed on: node
* Expected output: default JSON

`unmount`::
Unmounts a volume from a directory. This can include anything that is
necessary to clean up the volume after unmounting, such as detaching the volume
from the node.

* Arguments: `<mount-dir>`
* Executed on: node
* Expected output: default JSON

All other operations should return JSON with `{"status": "Not supported"}`
and exit code `1`.

[[flex-volume-installation]]
== Installing FlexVolume drivers

To install the FlexVolume driver:

. Ensure that the executable file exists on all masters and nodes in the cluster.

. Place the executable file at the volume plug-in path:
*_/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/<vendor>~<driver>/<driver>_*.

For example, to install the FlexVolume driver for the storage `foo`, place the
executable file at:
*_/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/openshift.com~foo/foo_*.

In {product-title} {product-version}, since *controller-manager* runs as a
static pod, the FlexVolume binary file that performs the attach and detach
operations must be a self-contained executable file with no external dependencies.

On Atomic hosts, the default location of the FlexVolume plug-in directory is
*_/etc/origin/kubelet-plugins/_*. You must place the FlexVolume executable file
in the *_/etc/origin/kubelet-plugins/volume/exec/<vendor>~<driver>/<driver>_*
directory on all master and nodes in the cluster.

[[flex-volume-usage]]
== Consuming storage using FlexVolume drivers

Use the `PersistentVolume` object to reference the installed storage. Each
`PersistentVolume` object in {product-title} represents one storage asset,
typically a volume, in the storage back-end.

.Persistent volume object definition using FlexVolume drivers example
[source,yaml]

----
<1> The name of the volume. This is how it is identified through
xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.adoc#architecture-additional-concepts-storage[persistent volume
claims] or from pods. This name can be different from the name of the volume on
back-end storage.
<2> The amount of storage allocated to this volume.
<3> The name of the driver. This field is mandatory.
<4> The file system that is present on the volume. This field is optional.
<5> The reference to a secret. Keys and values from this secret are
provided to the FlexVolume driver on invocation. This field is optional.
<6> The read-only flag. This field is optional.
<7> The additional options for the FlexVolume driver. In addition to the flags specified by the user in the `options` field, the following flags are also passed to the executable:
----
"fsType":"<FS type>",
"readwrite":"<rw>",
"secret/key1":"<secret1>"
...
"secret/keyN":"<secretN>"
