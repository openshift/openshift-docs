toc::[]

A hostPath volume in an {product-title} cluster mounts a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s filesystem into your pod. Most pods will not need a hostPath volume, but it does offer a quick option for testing should an application require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster administrator must configure pods to run as privileged. This grants access to pods in the same node.
