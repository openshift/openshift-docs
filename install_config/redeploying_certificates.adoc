== Overview

This topic reviews how to check cluster certificate expiration dates, back up
the certificates, and redeploy them using Ansible playbooks. This method fixes
common certificate errors. Possible use cases include:

- The installer detected the wrong host names and the issue was identified too late.
- The certificates are expired and you need to update them.
- You have a new CA and would like to create certificates using it instead

[[install-config-cert-expiry]]
== Checking Certificate Expirations

You can use the installer to warn you about any certificates expiring within a
configurable window of days and notify you about any certificates that have
already expired. Certificate expiry playbooks use the Ansible role
`openshift_certificate_expiry`.

Certificates examined by the role include:

- Master and node service certificates
- Router and registry service certificates from etcd secrets
- Master, node, router, registry, and *_kubeconfig_* files for *cluster-admin* users
- etcd certificates (including embedded)

[[install-config-cert-expiry-running-playbooks]]
=== Running Certificate Expiration Playbooks

The {product-title} installer provides a set of example certificate expiration
playbooks, using different sets of configuration for the
`openshift_certificate_expiry` role.

Just like the
xref:install-config-running-the-certificate-redeploy-playbook[redeploying certificates playbook], these playbooks must be used with an inventory that is
representative of the cluster. For best results, run `ansible-playbook` with the
`-v` option.

Using the *_easy-mode.yaml_* example playbook, you can try the role out before
tweaking it to your specifications as needed. This playbook:

- Produces JSON and stylized HTML reports in *_/tmp/_*.
- Sets the warning window very large, so you will almost always get results back.
- Includes all certificates (healthy or not) in the results.

.*_easy-mode.yaml_* Playbook
----
- name: Check cert expirys
  hosts: nodes:masters:etcd
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days: 1500
    openshift_certificate_expiry_save_json_results: yes
    openshift_certificate_expiry_generate_html_report: yes
    openshift_certificate_expiry_show_all: yes
  roles:
    - role: openshift_certificate_expiry
----

To run the *_easy-mode.yaml_*  playbook:

----
$ ansible-playbook -v -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/certificate_expiry/easy-mode.yaml
----

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-other-playbooks]]
==== Other Example Playbooks

The other example playbooks are also available to run directly out of the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/certificate_expiry/_*
directory.

.Other Example Playbooks
[options="header"]
|===

|File Name |Usage

|*_default.yaml_*
|Produces the default behavior of the `openshift_certificate_expiry` role.

|*_html_and_json_default_paths.yaml_*
|Generates HTML and JSON artifacts in their default paths.

|*_longer_warning_period.yaml_*
|Changes the expiration warning window to 1500 days.

|*_longer-warning-period-json-results.yaml_*
|Changes the expiration warning window to 1500 days and saves the results as a JSON file.

|===

To run any of these example playbooks:

----
$ ansible-playbook -v -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/certificate_expiry/<playbook>

[[cert-expiry-output-formats]]
=== Output Formats

As noted above, there are two ways to format your check report. In JSON format
for machine parsing, or as a stylized HTML page for easy skimming.

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-output-formats-html]]
==== HTML Report

An example of an HTML report is provided with the installer. You can open the
following file in your browser to view it:

*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_certificate_expiry/examples/cert-expiry-report.html_*

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-output-formats-json]]
==== JSON Report

There are two top-level keys in the saved JSON results: `data` and `summary`.

The `data` key is a hash where the keys are the names of each host examined and
the values are the check results for the certificates identified on each
respective host.

The `summary` key is a hash that summarizes the total number of certificates:

- examined on the entire cluster
- that are OK
- expiring within the configured warning window
- already expired

For an example of the full JSON report, see *_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_certificate_expiry/examples/cert-expiry-report.json_*.

The summary from the JSON data can be easily checked for warnings or expirations
using a variety of command-line tools. For example, using `grep` you can look
for the word `summary` and print out the two lines after the match (`-A2`):

----
$ grep -A2 summary /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
    "summary": {
        "warning": 16,
        "expired": 0
----

If available, the `jq` tool can also be used to pick out specific values. The
first two examples below show how to select just one value, either `warning` or
`expired`. The third example shows how to select both values at once:

----
$ jq '.summary.warning' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
16

$ jq '.summary.expired' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
0

$ jq '.summary.warning,.summary.expired' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
16
0
----

[[install-config-running-the-certificate-redeploy-playbook]]
== Running the Certificate Redeploy Playbook

Running the certificate redeploy playbook will redeploy {product-title}
certificates that exist on systems (master, node, etcd):

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[WARNING]
====
This playbook must be run with an inventory that is representative of the
cluster. The inventory must specify or override all host names and IP addresses
set via `*openshift_hostname*`, `*openshift_public_hostname*`, `*openshift_ip*`,
`*openshift_public_ip*`, `*openshift_master_cluster_hostname*`, or
`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*` such that they match the current
cluster configuration.
====

By default, the redeploy playbook does _not_ redeploy the {product-title} CA.
New certificates are created using the original {product-title} CA.

To redeploy all certificates including the {product-title} CA, specify
`openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true`.

For example:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml \
--extra-vars "openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true"
----

This also adds a
xref:../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[custom
CA certificate]:

====
----
# Configure custom ca certificate
# NOTE: CA certificate will not be replaced with existing clusters.
# This option may only be specified when creating a new cluster or
# when redeploying cluster certificates with the redeploy-certificates
# playbook.
#openshift_master_ca_certificate={'certfile': '/path/to/ca.crt', 'keyfile': '/path/to/ca.key'}
----
====

All pods using service accounts to communicate with the {product-title} API must
be redeployed when the {product-title} CA is replaced so the certificate
redeploy playbook will serially evacuate all nodes in the cluster when this
variable is set.

[[manually-update-certificates-for-the-registry-and-router]]
== Manually Update Certificates for the Registry and Router

When nodes are evacuated, routers are restarted and outages to data plans are
possible. This results in the routers not being able to reach the masters
because they have old certificates. To manually update certificates:

. Add registry certificates to a secret named `registry-certificates`. To update
the certificate, create a new certificate, then update it within the
`registry-certificates` secret:
+
----
REGISTRY_IP=`oc get service docker-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'`

REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=`oc get route/docker-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`

$ oc adm ca create-server-cert \
  --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
  --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
  --hostnames=$REGISTRY_IP,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,$REGISTRY_HOSTNAME \
  --cert=/etc/origin/master/registry.crt \
  --key=/etc/origin/master/registry.key \
  --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt

$ oc secret new registry-certificates \
  /etc/origin/master/registry.crt \
  /etc/origin/master/registry.key \
  -o json | oc replace -f -
----

. Redeploy the registry:
+
----
$ oc deploy dc/docker-registry --latest
----

. The router is secured using a service serving certificate secret, which was
automatically created after adding an annotation to the router service. That
service serving certificate can be triggered to be recreated by deleting the
service, then clearing or re-adding annotations to the router service:

----
$ oc delete secret router-certs

$ oc annotate service router \
  service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name- \
  service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-signed-by-

$ oc annotate service router \
  service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=router-certs

$ oc deploy dc/router --latest
----
