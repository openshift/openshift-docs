== Overview
This topic reviews how to back up and redeploy cluster certificates using the
`ansible-playbook` command. This method fixes common certificate errors. Possible use
cases include:

- The installer detected the wrong host names and the issue was identified too late.
- The certificates are expired and you need to update them.
- You have a new CA and would like to create certificates using it instead

== Running the Certificate Redeploy Playbook

Running the certificate redeploy playbook will redeploy {product-title}
certificates that exist on systems (master, node, etcd):

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[WARNING]
====
This playbook must be run with an inventory that is representative of the
cluster. The inventory must specify or override all host names and IP addresses
set via `*openshift_hostname*`, `*openshift_public_hostname*`, `*openshift_ip*`,
`*openshift_public_ip*`, `*openshift_master_cluster_hostname*`, or
`*openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname*` such that they match the current
cluster configuration.
====

By default, the redeploy playbook does _not_ redeploy the {product-title} CA.
New certificates are created using the original {product-title} CA.

To redeploy all certificates including the {product-title} CA, specify
`openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true`.

For example:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory> playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/redeploy-certificates.yml \
--extra-vars "openshift_certificates_redeploy_ca=true"
----

This also adds a
xref:../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[custom
CA certificate]:

====
----
# Configure custom ca certificate
# NOTE: CA certificate will not be replaced with existing clusters.
# This option may only be specified when creating a new cluster or
# when redeploying cluster certificates with the redeploy-certificates
# playbook.
#openshift_master_ca_certificate={'certfile': '/path/to/ca.crt', 'keyfile': '/path/to/ca.key'}
----
====

All pods using service accounts to communicate with the {product-title} API must
be redeployed when the {product-title} CA is replaced so the certificate
redeploy playbook will serially evacuate all nodes in the cluster when this
variable is set.
