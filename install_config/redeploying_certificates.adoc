== Overview

{product-title} uses certificates to provide secure connections for the
following components:

- masters (API server and controllers)
- etcd
- nodes
- registry
- router

You can use Ansible playbooks provided with the installer to automate checking
expiration dates for cluster certificates. Playbooks are also provided to
automate backing up and redeploying these certificates, which can fix common
certificate errors.

Possible use cases for redeploying certificates include:

- The installer detected the wrong host names and the issue was identified too late.
- The certificates are expired and you need to update them.
- You have a new CA and want to create certificates using it instead.

[[install-config-cert-expiry]]
== Checking Certificate Expirations

You can use the installer to warn you about any certificates expiring within a
configurable window of days and notify you about any certificates that have
already expired. Certificate expiry playbooks use the Ansible role
`openshift_certificate_expiry`.

Certificates examined by the role include:

- Master and node service certificates
- Router and registry service certificates from etcd secrets
- Master, node, router, registry, and *_kubeconfig_* files for *cluster-admin* users
- etcd certificates (including embedded)

[[install-config-cert-expiry-running-playbooks]]
=== Running Certificate Expiration Playbooks

The {product-title} installer provides a set of example certificate expiration
playbooks, using different sets of configuration for the
`openshift_certificate_expiry` role.

These playbooks must be used with an
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory file] that is representative of the cluster. For best results, run
`ansible-playbook` with the `-v` option.

Using the *_easy-mode.yaml_* example playbook, you can try the role out before
tweaking it to your specifications as needed. This playbook:

- Produces JSON and stylized HTML reports in *_/tmp/_*.
- Sets the warning window very large, so you will almost always get results back.
- Includes all certificates (healthy or not) in the results.

.*_easy-mode.yaml_* Playbook
----
- name: Check cert expirys
  hosts: nodes:masters:etcd
  become: yes
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    openshift_certificate_expiry_warning_days: 1500
    openshift_certificate_expiry_save_json_results: yes
    openshift_certificate_expiry_generate_html_report: yes
    openshift_certificate_expiry_show_all: yes
  roles:
    - role: openshift_certificate_expiry
----

To run the *_easy-mode.yaml_*  playbook:

----
$ ansible-playbook -v -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/certificate_expiry/easy-mode.yaml
----

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-other-playbooks]]
==== Other Example Playbooks

The other example playbooks are also available to run directly out of the
*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/certificate_expiry/_*
directory.

.Other Example Playbooks
[options="header"]
|===

|File Name |Usage

|*_default.yaml_*
|Produces the default behavior of the `openshift_certificate_expiry` role.

|*_html_and_json_default_paths.yaml_*
|Generates HTML and JSON artifacts in their default paths.

|*_longer_warning_period.yaml_*
|Changes the expiration warning window to 1500 days.

|*_longer-warning-period-json-results.yaml_*
|Changes the expiration warning window to 1500 days and saves the results as a JSON file.

|===

To run any of these example playbooks:

----
$ ansible-playbook -v -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-checks/certificate_expiry/<playbook>
----

[[cert-expiry-output-formats]]
=== Output Formats

As noted above, there are two ways to format your check report. In JSON format
for machine parsing, or as a stylized HTML page for easy skimming.

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-output-formats-html]]
==== HTML Report

An example of an HTML report is provided with the installer. You can open the
following file in your browser to view it:

*_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_certificate_expiry/examples/cert-expiry-report.html_*

[discrete]
[[cert-expiry-output-formats-json]]
==== JSON Report

There are two top-level keys in the saved JSON results: `data` and `summary`.

The `data` key is a hash where the keys are the names of each host examined and
the values are the check results for the certificates identified on each
respective host.

The `summary` key is a hash that summarizes the total number of certificates:

- examined on the entire cluster
- that are OK
- expiring within the configured warning window
- already expired

For an example of the full JSON report, see *_/usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/roles/openshift_certificate_expiry/examples/cert-expiry-report.json_*.

The summary from the JSON data can be easily checked for warnings or expirations
using a variety of command-line tools. For example, using `grep` you can look
for the word `summary` and print out the two lines after the match (`-A2`):

----
$ grep -A2 summary /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
    "summary": {
        "warning": 16,
        "expired": 0
----

If available, the `jq` tool can also be used to pick out specific values. The
first two examples below show how to select just one value, either `warning` or
`expired`. The third example shows how to select both values at once:

----
$ jq '.summary.warning' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
16

$ jq '.summary.expired' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
0

$ jq '.summary.warning,.summary.expired' /tmp/cert-expiry-report.json
16
0
----

[[redeploy-certificates]]
== Redeploying Certificates

Use the following playbooks to redeploy master, etcd, node, registry, and router
certificates on all relevant hosts. You can redeploy all of them at once using
the current CA, redeploy certificates for specific components only, or redeploy
a newly generated or custom CA on its own.

Just like the certificate expiry playbooks, these playbooks must be run with an
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#configuring-ansible[inventory file] that is representative of the cluster.

In particular, the inventory must specify or override all host names and IP
addresses set via the following variables such that they match the current
cluster configuration:

- `openshift_hostname`
- `openshift_public_hostname`
- `openshift_ip`
- `openshift_public_ip`
- `openshift_master_cluster_hostname`
- `openshift_master_cluster_public_hostname`

The playbooks you need are provided by:

----
# yum install atomic-openshift-utils
----

[NOTE]
====
The validity (length in days until they expire) for any certificates
auto-generated while redeploying can be configured via Ansible as well. See
xref:../install/configuring_inventory_file.adoc#advanced-install-config-certificate-validity[Configuring Certificate Validity].
====

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} CA and etcd certificates expire after five years. Signed {product-title} certificates expire after two years.
====

[[redeploying-all-certificates-current-ca]]
=== Redeploying All Certificates Using the Current {product-title} and etcd CA

The *_redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook does _not_ regenerate the
{product-title} CA certificate. New master, etcd, node, registry, and router
certificates are created using the current CA certificate to sign new
certificates.

This also includes serial restarts of:

- etcd
- master services
- node services

To redeploy master, etcd, and node certificates using the current
{product-title} CA, run this playbook, specifying your inventory file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[[redeploying-new-custom-ca]]
=== Redeploying a New or Custom {product-title} CA

The *_openshift-master/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml_* playbook redeploys the {product-title} CA
certificate by generating a new CA certificate and distributing an updated
bundle to all components including client *_kubeconfig_* files and the node's
database of trusted CAs (the CA-trust).

This also includes serial restarts of:

- master services
- node services
- docker

Additionally, you can specify a
xref:../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[custom CA certificate] when redeploying certificates instead of relying on a CA
generated by {product-title}.

When the master services are restarted, the registry and routers can continue to
communicate with the master without being redeployed because the master's
serving certificate is the same, and the CA the registry and routers have are
still valid.

To redeploy a newly generated or custom CA:

. If you want to use a custom CA, set the following variable in your inventory
file. To use the current CA, skip this step.
+
----
# Configure custom ca certificate
# NOTE: CA certificate will not be replaced with existing clusters.
# This option may only be specified when creating a new cluster or
# when redeploying cluster certificates with the redeploy-certificates
# playbook.
openshift_master_ca_certificate={'certfile': '</path/to/ca.crt>', 'keyfile': '</path/to/ca.key>'}
----
+
If the CA certificate is issued by an intermediate CA, the bundled certificate must contain 
the full chain (the intermediate and root certificates) for the CA in order to validate child certificates. 
+
For example:
+
----
$ cat intermediate/certs/intermediate.cert.pem \
      certs/ca.cert.pem >> intermediate/certs/ca-chain.cert.pem
----

. Run the *_openshift-master/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml_* playbook, specifying your inventory file:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-master/redeploy-openshift-ca.yml
----

With the new {product-title} CA in place, you can then use the
xref:redeploying-all-certificates-current-ca[*_openshift-master/redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook] at your discretion whenever you want to redeploy certificates signed
by the new CA on all components.

[[redeploying-new-etcd-ca]]
=== Redeploying a New etcd CA

The *_openshift-etcd/redeploy-ca.yml_* playbook redeploys the etcd CA
certificate by generating a new CA certificate and distributing an updated
bundle to all etcd peers and master clients.

This also includes serial restarts of:

- etcd
- master services

To redeploy a newly generated etcd CA:

. Run the *_openshift-etcd/redeploy-ca.yml_* playbook, specifying your inventory file:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-etcd/redeploy-ca.yml
----

With the new etcd CA in place, you can then use the
xref:redeploying-etcd-certificates[*_openshift-etcd/redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook] at your discretion whenever you want to redeploy certificates signed
by the new etcd CA on etcd peers and master clients. Alternatively, you can use the
xref:redeploying-all-certificates-current-ca[*_redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook] to redeploy certificates for {product-title} components in addition to etcd peers and master clients.

[[redeploying-master-certificates]]
=== Redeploying Master Certificates Only

The *_openshift-master/redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook only redeploys master
certificates. This also includes serial restarts of master services.

To redeploy master certificates, run this playbook, specifying your inventory
file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-master/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
After running this playbook, you need to regenerate any xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#service-serving-certificate-secrets[service signing certificate or key pairs] 
by deleting existing secrets that contain service serving certificates or removing and re-adding 
annotations to appropriate services.
====


[[redeploying-etcd-certificates]]
=== Redeploying etcd Certificates Only

The *_openshift-etcd/redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook only redeploys etcd certificates
including master client certificates.

This also include serial restarts of:

- etcd
- master services.

To redeploy etcd certificates, run this playbook, specifying your inventory
file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-etcd/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[[redeploying-node-certificates]]
=== Redeploying Node Certificates Only

The *_openshift-node/redeploy-certificates.yml_* playbook only redeploys node
certificates. This also include serial restarts of node services.

To redeploy node certificates, run this playbook, specifying your inventory
file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-node/redeploy-certificates.yml
----

[[redeploying-registry-router-certificates]]
=== Redeploying Registry or Router Certificates Only

The *_openshift-hosted/redeploy-registry-certificates.yml_* and
*_openshift-hosted/redeploy-router-certificates.yml_* playbooks replace installer-created
certificates for the registry and router. If custom certificates are in use for
these components, see
xref:redeploying-custom-registry-or-router-certificates[Redeploying Custom
Registry or Router Certificates] to replace them manually.

[[redeploying-registry-certificates]]
==== Redeploying Registry Certificates Only

To redeploy registry certificates, run the following playbook, specifying your
inventory file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-hosted/redeploy-registry-certificates.yml
----

[[redeploying-router-certificates]]
==== Redeploying Router Certificates Only

To redeploy router certificates, run the following playbook, specifying your
inventory file:

----
$ ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openshift-hosted/redeploy-router-certificates.yml
----

[[redeploying-custom-registry-or-router-certificates]]
=== Redeploying Custom Registry or Router Certificates

When nodes are evacuated due to a redeployed CA, registry and router pods are
restarted. If the registry and router certificates were not also redeployed with
the new CA, this can cause outages because they cannot reach the masters using
their old certificates.

The playbooks for redeploying certificates cannot redeploy custom registry or
router certificates, so to address this issue, you can manually redeploy the
registry and router certificates.

[[redeploying-registry-certificates-manually]]
==== Redeploying Registry Certificates Manually

To redeploy registry certificates manually, you must add new registry
certificates to a secret named `registry-certificates`, then redeploy the
registry:

. Switch to the `default` project for the remainder of these steps:
+
----
$ oc project default
----

. If your registry was initially created on {product-title} 3.1 or earlier, it may
still be using environment variables to store certificates (which has been
deprecated in favor of using secrets).

.. Run the following and look for the
`OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA`, `OPENSHIFT_CERT_DATA`, `OPENSHIFT_KEY_DATA` environment
variables:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry --list
----

.. If they do not exist, skip this step. If they do, create the following `ClusterRoleBinding`:
+
----
$ cat <<EOF |
apiVersion: v1
groupNames: null
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: registry-registry-role
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:registry
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: registry
  namespace: default
userNames:
- system:serviceaccount:default:registry
EOF
oc create -f -
----
+
Then, run the following to remove the environment variables:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA- OPENSHIFT_CERT_DATA- OPENSHIFT_KEY_DATA- OPENSHIFT_MASTER-
----

. Set the following environment variables locally to make later commands less
complex:
+
----
$ REGISTRY_IP=`oc get service docker-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}'`
$ REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=`oc get route/docker-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'`
----

. Create new registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --hostnames=$REGISTRY_IP,docker-registry.default.svc,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,$REGISTRY_HOSTNAME \
    --cert=/etc/origin/master/registry.crt \
    --key=/etc/origin/master/registry.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt
----
+
Run `oc adm` commands only from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*. 

. Update the `registry-certificates` secret with the new registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic registry-certificates \
    --from-file=/etc/origin/master/registry.crt,/etc/origin/master/registry.key \
    -o json --dry-run | oc replace -f -
----

. Redeploy the registry:
+
----
$ oc rollout latest dc/docker-registry
----

[[redeploying-router-certificates-manually]]
==== Redeploying Router Certificates Manually

When routers are initially deployed, an annotation is added to the router's
service that automatically creates a
xref:../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#service-serving-certificate-secrets[service serving certificate secret].

To redeploy router certificates manually, that service serving certificate can
be triggered to be recreated by deleting the secret, removing and re-adding
annotations to the `router` service, then redeploying the router:

. Switch to the `default` project for the remainder of these steps:
+
----
$ oc project default
----

. If your router was initially created on {product-title} 3.1 or earlier, it might
still use environment variables to store certificates, which has been
deprecated in favor of using service serving certificate secret.

.. Run the following command and look for the
`OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA`, `OPENSHIFT_CERT_DATA`, `OPENSHIFT_KEY_DATA` environment
variables:
+
----
$ oc env dc/router --list
----

.. If those variables exist, create the following `ClusterRoleBinding`:
+
----
$ cat <<EOF |
apiVersion: v1
groupNames: null
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: router-router-role
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:router
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: router
  namespace: default
userNames:
- system:serviceaccount:default:router
EOF
oc create -f -
----

.. If those variables exist, run the following command to remove them:
+
----
$ oc env dc/router OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA- OPENSHIFT_CERT_DATA- OPENSHIFT_KEY_DATA- OPENSHIFT_MASTER-
----

. Obtain a certificate.
* If you use an external Certificate Authority (CA) to sign your certificates,
create a new certificate and provide it to {product-title} by following your
internal processes.
* If you use the internal {product-title} CA to sign certificates, run the
following commands:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following commands generate a certificate that is internally signed. It will
be trusted by only clients that trust the {product-title} CA.
====
+
----
$ cd /root
$ mkdir cert ; cd cert
$ oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt \
    --hostnames='*.hostnames.for.the.certificate' \
    --cert=router.crt \
    --key=router.key \

----
+
These commands generate the following files:
+
** A new certificate named *_router.crt_*.
** A copy of the signing CA certificate chain, *_/etc/origin/master/ca.crt_*.
This chain can contain more than one certificate if you use intermediate CAs.
** A corresponding private key named *_router.key_*.

. Create a new file that concatenates the generated certificates:
+
----
$ cat router.crt /etc/origin/master/ca.crt router.key > router.pem
----

. Before you generate a new secret, back up the current one:
+
----
$ oc export secret router-certs > ~/old-router-certs-secret.yaml
----

. Create a new secret to hold the new certificate and key, and replace the 
contents of the existing secret:
+
----
$ oc create secret tls router-certs --cert=router.pem \ <1>
    --key=router.key -o json --dry-run | \
    oc replace -f -
----
<1> *_router.pem_* is the file that contains the concatenation of the
certificates that you generated.    

. Remove the following annotations from the `router` service:
+
----
$ oc annotate service router \
    service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name- \
    service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-signed-by-
----

. Re-add the annotations:
+
----
$ oc annotate service router \
    service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name=router-certs
----

. Redeploy the router:
+
----
$ oc rollout latest dc/router
----
