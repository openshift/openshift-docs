== About the Registry

{product-title} can build
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.adoc#docker-images[container
images] from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To
enable this, {product-title} provides an internal,
xref:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.adoc#integrated-openshift-registry[integrated
Docker registry] that can be deployed in your {product-title} environment to
locally manage images.

== Integrated or Stand-alone Registries

During an initial installation of a full {product-title} cluster, it is likely
that the registry was deployed automatically during the installation process. If
it was not, or if you want to further customize the configuration of your
registry, see
xref:../../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#install-config-deploy-registry-existing-clusters[Deploying
a Registry on Existing Clusters].

While it can be deployed to run as an integrated part of your full
{product-title} cluster, the {product-title} registry can alternatively be
installed separately as a stand-alone container image registry.

To install a stand-alone registry, follow
xref:../../install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing a Stand-alone Registry]. This installation path deploys an all-in-one cluster
running a registry and specialized web console.
