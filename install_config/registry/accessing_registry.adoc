[[registry-viewing-logs]]
== Viewing Logs

To view the logs for the Docker registry, use the `oc logs` command with the
deployment config:

[[registry-file-storage]]
== File Storage

Tag and image metadata is stored in {product-title}, but the registry stores
layer and signature data in a volume that is mounted into the registry container
at *_/registry_*. As `oc exec` does not work on privileged containers, to view a
registry's contents you must manually SSH into the node housing the registry
pod's container, then run `docker exec` on the container itself:

. List the current pods to find the pod name of your Docker registry:
+
----
# oc get pods
----
+
Then, use `oc describe` to find the host name for the node running the
container:
+
----
# oc describe pod <pod_name>
----

. Log into the desired node:
+
----
# ssh node.example.com
----

. List the running containers on the node host and identify the container ID for
the Docker registry:
+
----
# docker ps | grep ose-docker-registry
----

. List the registry contents using the `docker exec` command:
+
====

[[access]]
== Accessing the Registry Directly
For advanced usage, you can access the registry directly to invoke `docker`
commands. This allows you to push images to or pull them from the integrated
registry directly using operations like `docker push` or `docker pull`. To do
so, you must be logged in to the registry using the `docker login` command. The
operations you can perform depend on your user permissions, as described in the
following sections.

[[access-user-prerequisites]]
=== User Prerequisites
To access the registry directly, the user that you use must satisfy the
following, depending on your intended usage:

- For any direct access, you must have a
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[regular
user], if one does not already exist, for your
preferred xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[identity
provider]. A regular user can generate an access token required for logging in to
the registry.
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.adoc#users[System
users], such as *system:admin*, cannot obtain access tokens and, therefore,
cannot access the registry directly.
+
For example, if you are using `HTPASSWD` authentication, you can create one
using the following command:
+
----
# htpasswd /etc/origin/openshift-htpasswd <user_name>
----

- The user must have the *system:registry* role. To add this role:
+
----
# oadm policy add-role-to-user system:registry <user_name>
----

- Have the *admin* role for the project associated with the Docker operation. For
example, if accessing images in the global *openshift* project:
+
----
 $ oadm policy add-role-to-user admin <user_name> -n openshift
----

- For writing or pushing images, for example when using the `docker push` command,
the user must have the *system:image-builder* role. To add this role:
+
----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user system:image-builder <user_name>
----

For more information on user permissions, see
xref:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.adoc#managing-role-bindings[Managing
Role Bindings].

[[access-logging-in-to-the-registry]]
=== Logging in to the Registry

[NOTE]
====
Ensure your user satisfies the xref:access-user-prerequisites[prerequisites]
for accessing the registry directly.
====

To log in to the registry directly:

. Ensure you are logged in to {product-title} as a *regular user*:
+
----
$ oc login
----

. Get your access token:
+
----
$ oc whoami -t
----

. Log in to the Docker registry:
+
----
$ docker login -u <username> -e <any_email_address> \
    -p <token_value> <registry_ip>:<port>
----

[[access-pushing-and-pulling-images]]
=== Pushing and Pulling Images
After xref:access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logging in to the registry], you
can perform `docker pull` and `docker push` operations against your registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can pull arbitrary images, but if you have the *system:registry* role
added, you can only push images to the registry in your project.
====

In the following examples, we use:
|====

|Component |Value

|*<registry_ip>*
|`172.30.124.220`

|*<port>*
|`5000`

|*<project>*
|`openshift`

|*<image>*
|`busybox`

|*<tag>*
| omitted (defaults to `latest`)

|====

. Pull an arbitrary image:
+
====
----
$ docker pull docker.io/busybox
----
====

. Tag the new image with the form `<registry_ip>:<port>/<project>/<image>`.
The project name *must* appear in this
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[pull specification]
for {product-title} to
correctly place and later access the image in the registry.
+
====
----
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Your regular user must have the *system:image-builder* role for the specified
project, which allows the user to write or push an image. Otherwise, the `docker
push` in the next step will fail. To test, you can
xref:../../dev_guide/projects.adoc#create-a-project[create a new project] to
push the *busybox* image.
====

. Push the newly-tagged image to your registry:
+
====
----
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
...
cf2616975b4a: Image successfully pushed
Digest: sha256:3662dd821983bc4326bee12caec61367e7fb6f6a3ee547cbaff98f77403cab55
----
====

[[access-reading-and-writing-image-signatures]]
=== Reading and Writing Image Signatures
The {product-title} integrated Docker Registry provides an "extensions" endpoint that
allows you to write and read image signatures.
The image signatures are stored in the {product-title} key-value store via Docker Registry API.

[NOTE]
====
This endpoint is experimental and not supported by the upstream Docker Registry project.
See link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/[upstream API documentation] for
general information about the Docker Registry API.
====

[[writing-image-signatures]]
==== Writing Image Signatures
In order to add a new signature to the Image, users can use the HTTP `PUT` method together
with the JSON payload sent the extensions endpoint:

====
----
PUT /extensions/v2/{namespace}/{name}/signatures/{digest}
----
====

====
----
$ curl -X PUT --data @signature.json http://<user>:<token>@<registry-endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----
====

The JSON payload with the signature content should have the following structure:

====
----
{
  "version": 2,
  "type":    "atomic",
  "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
  "content": "<base64 encoded signature>",
}
----
====

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which has to be unique and in
the following format: `<digest>@<name>`. The first part (`<digest>`) represents an image
name and the second part (`<name>`) is the name of the signature.
The signature name has to be 32 characters long.

[NOTE]
====
In order to attach the signature to the Docker image the user must have the `system:image-signer` role.
====

[[reading-image-signatures]]
==== Reading Image Signatures
Assuming that you have already pushed the signed Docker image into the {product-title} integrated Docker
Registry, you can read the signatures using the following command:

====
----
GET /extensions/v2/{namespace}/{name}/signatures/{digest}
----
====

====
----
$ curl http://<user>:<token>@<registry-endpoint>:5000/extensions/v2/<namespace>/<name>/signatures/sha256:<digest>
----
====

Where the `namespace` represents the {product-title} project name or Docker Registry repository name and the `name`
refers to the name of the repository. The `digest` represents the SHA256 checksum of the image.

If the given Image contains the signature data, the output of the command above should
produce following JSON response:

====
----
{
  "signatures": [
  {
    "version": 2,
    "type":    "atomic",
    "name":    "sha256:4028782c08eae4a8c9a28bf661c0a8d1c2fc8e19dbaae2b018b21011197e1484@cddeb7006d914716e2728000746a0b23",
    "content": "<base64 encoded signature>",
  }
  ]
}
----
====

The `name` field contains the name of the image signature, which is unique and in the
following format: `<digest>@<name>` where the `<digest>` represents the name of the image.
The `name` has to be 32 character long.
The `content` contains BASE64 encoded signature data (usually a GPG signed data).
