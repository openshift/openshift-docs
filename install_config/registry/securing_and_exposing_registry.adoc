== Overview

By default, the {product-title} registry is secured during cluster
installation so that it serves traffic via TLS. A passthrough route is also
created by default to expose the service externally.

If for any reason your registry has not been secured or exposed, see the
following sections for steps on how to manually do so.

[[securing-the-registry]]
== Manually Securing the Registry

To manually secure the registry to serve traffic via TLS:

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
. xref:../../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#install-config-deploy-registry-existing-clusters[Deploy the registry].
+
endif::[]
. Fetch the service IP and port of the registry:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP(S)            PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.124.220   5000/TCP
----
+
. You can use an existing server certificate, or create a key and server
certificate valid for specified IPs and host names, signed by a specified CA. To
create a server certificate for the registry service IP and the
*docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local* host name,
run the following command from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*:
+
----
$ oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --signer-cert=/etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
    --signer-key=/etc/origin/master/ca.key \
    --signer-serial=/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt \
    --hostnames='docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,docker-registry.default.svc,172.30.124.220' \
    --cert=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    --key=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
If the router will be xref:exposing-the-registry[exposed externally], add the
public route host name in the `--hostnames` flag:
+
----
--hostnames='mydocker-registry.example.com,docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local,172.30.124.220 \
----
+
See
xref:../../install_config/redeploying_certificates.adoc#redeploying-registry-router-certificates[Redeploying
Registry and Router Certificates] for additional details on updating the
default certificate so that the route is externally accessible.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm ca create-server-cert` command generates a certificate that is valid
for two years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but for
security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than this value.
====
+
. Create the secret for the registry certificates:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-certificates \
    /etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    /etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
. Add the secret to the registry pod's service accounts (including the *default*
service account):
+
----
$ oc secrets link registry registry-certificates
$ oc secrets link default  registry-certificates
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Limiting secrets to only the service accounts that reference them is disabled by
default. This means that if `serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences` is set
to `false` (the default setting) in the master configuration file, linking
secrets to a service is not required.
====
+
. Pause the `docker-registry` service:
+
----
$ oc rollout pause dc/docker-registry
----
+
. Add the secret volume to the registry deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-certificates -m /etc/secrets
----
+
. Enable TLS by adding the following environment variables to the registry
deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc set env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE=/etc/secrets/registry.crt \
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY=/etc/secrets/registry.key
----
+
See the link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#override-specific-configuration-options[Configuring a registry section of the Docker documentation] for more information.

. Update the scheme used for the registry's liveness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+
----
$ oc patch dc/docker-registry -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers":[{
    "name":"registry",
    "livenessProbe":  {"httpGet": {"scheme":"HTTPS"}}
  }]}}}}'
----

. If your registry was initially deployed on {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.2
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.1.2
endif::[]
or later, update the scheme used for the registry's readiness probe from HTTP to HTTPS:
+
----
$ oc patch dc/docker-registry -p '{"spec": {"template": {"spec": {"containers":[{
    "name":"registry",
    "readinessProbe":  {"httpGet": {"scheme":"HTTPS"}}
  }]}}}}'
----
+
. Resume the `docker-registry` service:
+
----
$ oc rollout resume dc/docker-registry
----
+
. Validate the registry is running in TLS mode. Wait until the latest *docker-registry*
deployment completes and verify the Docker logs for the registry container. You should
find an entry for `listening on :5000, tls`.
+
----
$ oc logs dc/docker-registry | grep tls
time="2015-05-27T05:05:53Z" level=info msg="listening on :5000, tls" instance.id=deeba528-c478-41f5-b751-dc48e4935fc2
----
+
. Copy the CA certificate to the Docker certificates directory. This must be
done on all nodes in the cluster:
+
----
$ dcertsdir=/etc/docker/certs.d
$ destdir_addr=$dcertsdir/172.30.124.220:5000
$ destdir_name=$dcertsdir/docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:5000

$ sudo mkdir -p $destdir_addr $destdir_name
$ sudo cp ca.crt $destdir_addr    //<1>
$ sudo cp ca.crt $destdir_name
----
<1> The *_ca.crt_* file is a copy
    of *_/etc/origin/master/ca.crt_* on the master.
+
. When using authentication, some versions of `docker` also require you to
configure your cluster to trust the certificate at the OS level.

.. Copy the certificate:
+
----
$ cp /etc/origin/master/ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/myregistrydomain.com.crt
----

.. Run:
+
----
$ update-ca-trust enable
----

. Remove the `--insecure-registry` option only for this particular registry in
the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file. Then, reload the daemon and restart the
*docker* service to reflect this configuration change:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----
+
. Validate the `docker` client connection. Running
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/push/[`docker push`]
to the registry or
https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/pull/[`docker pull`] from the registry should succeed.  Make sure you have
xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logged into the registry].
+
----
$ docker tag|push <registry/image> <internal_registry/project/image>
----
+
For example:
+
----
$ docker pull busybox
$ docker tag docker.io/busybox 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox
$ docker push 172.30.124.220:5000/openshift/busybox

[[exposing-the-registry]]
== Manually Exposing a Secure Registry

Instead of logging in to the {product-title} registry from within the
{product-title} cluster, you can gain external access to it by first securing
the registry and then exposing it with a route. This allows you to log in to the
registry from outside the cluster using the route address, and to tag and push
images using the route host.

. Each of the following prerequisite steps are performed by default during a
typical cluster installation. If they have not been, perform them manually:

.. xref:../../install_config/registry/deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#install-config-deploy-registry-existing-clusters[Manually deploy the registry].

.. xref:securing-the-registry[Manually secure the registry].

.. xref:../../install_config/router/index.adoc#install-config-router-overview[Manually deploy a router].

. A xref:../../architecture/networking/routes.adoc#passthrough-termination[passthrough]
route should have been created by default for the registry during the initial
cluster installation:

.. Verify whether the route exists:
+
----
$ oc get route/docker-registry -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: docker-registry
spec:
  host: <host> <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: docker-registry <2>
  tls:
    termination: passthrough <3>
----
<1> The host for your route. You must be able to resolve this name externally via
DNS to the router's IP address.
<2> The service name for your registry.
<3> Specifies this route as a passthrough route.
+
[NOTE]
====
Passthrough is currently the only type of route supported for exposing the
secure registry.
====

.. If it does not exist, create the route via the `oc create route passthrough`
command, specifying the registry as the routeâ€™s service. By default, the name of
the created route is the same as the service name:

... Get the *docker-registry* service details:
+
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              CLUSTER_IP       EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)                 SELECTOR                  AGE
docker-registry   172.30.69.167    <none>        5000/TCP                docker-registry=default   4h
kubernetes        172.30.0.1       <none>        443/TCP,53/UDP,53/TCP   <none>                    4h
router            172.30.172.132   <none>        80/TCP                  router=router             4h
----

... Create the route:
+
----
$ oc create route passthrough    \
    --service=docker-registry    \//<1>
    --hostname=<host>
route "docker-registry" created     <2>
----
<1> Specifies the registry as the route's service.
<2> The route name is identical to the service name.

. Next, you must trust the certificates being used for the registry on your host
system. The certificates referenced were created when you secured your registry.
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo cp <ca_certificate_file> /etc/docker/certs.d/<host>
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----

. xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-logging-in-to-the-registry[Log in to the registry] using the information from securing the registry. However, this time
point to the host name used in the route rather than your service IP. When
logging in to a secured and exposed registry, make sure you specify the registry
in the `docker login` command:
+
----
# docker login -e user@company.com \
    -u f83j5h6 \
    -p Ju1PeM47R0B92Lk3AZp-bWJSck2F7aGCiZ66aFGZrs2 \
    <host>
----

. You can now tag and push images using the route host. For example, to tag and
push a `busybox` image in a project called `test`:
+
----
$ oc get imagestreams -n test
NAME      DOCKER REPO   TAGS      UPDATED

$ docker pull busybox
$ docker tag busybox <host>/test/busybox
$ docker push <host>/test/busybox
The push refers to a repository [<host>/test/busybox] (len: 1)

----
+
[NOTE]
====
Your image streams will have the IP address and port of the registry service,
not the route name and port. See `oc get imagestreams` for details.
====

[[access-insecure-registry-by-exposing-route]]
== Manually Exposing a Non-Secure Registry

Instead of securing the registry in order to expose the registry, you can simply
expose a non-secure registry for non-production {product-title} environments.
This allows you to have an external route to the registry without using SSL
certificates.

[WARNING]
====
Only non-production environments should expose a non-secure registry to external access.
====

To expose a non-secure registry:

. Expose the registry:
+
----
# oc expose service docker-registry --hostname=<hostname> -n default
----
+
This creates the following JSON file:
+
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    docker-registry: default
  name: docker-registry
spec:
  host: registry.example.com
  port:
    targetPort: "5000"
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: docker-registry
status: {}
----
. Verify that the route has been created successfully:
+
----
# oc get route
NAME              HOST/PORT                    PATH      SERVICE           LABELS                    INSECURE POLICY   TLS TERMINATION
docker-registry   registry.example.com            docker-registry   docker-registry=default
----
. Check the health of the registry:
+
----
$ curl -v http://registry.example.com/healthz
----
+
Expect an HTTP 200/OK message.
+
After exposing the registry, update your *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file by
adding the port number to the `OPTIONS` entry. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS='--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry=172.30.0.0/16 --insecure-registry registry.example.com:80'
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The above options should be added on the client from which you are trying to log in.

Also, ensure that Docker is running on the client.
====

When
xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-logging-in-to-the-registry[logging in] to the non-secured and exposed registry, make sure you specify the registry
in the `docker login` command. For example:

----
# docker login -e user@company.com \
    -u f83j5h6 \
    -p Ju1PeM47R0B92Lk3AZp-bWJSck2F7aGCiZ66aFGZrs2 \
    <host>
