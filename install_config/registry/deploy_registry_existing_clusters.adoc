== Overview

If the integrated registry was not previously deployed automatically during the
initial installation of your {product-title} cluster, or if it is no longer
running successfully and you need to redeploy it on your existing cluster, see
the following sections for options on deploying a new registry.

[NOTE]

[[registry-deploymentconfig]]
=== Standard Deployment as a DeploymentConfig

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[NOTE]
====
Until an advanced installation method for {product-title} is tested and documented, refer to the
xref:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.adoc#registry-quickstart-administrators-index[quickstart install]
information.
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oc adm registry` command from
the *_admin.kubeconfig_* file's location, as a user with cluster administrator
privileges:

----
$ oc adm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --service-account=registry <2>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oc adm registry` command as a
user with cluster administrator privileges. For example:

----
$ oc adm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --service-account=registry \//<2>
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' <3>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
<1> `--config` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file] for
the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster
administrator].
<2> `--service-account` is the service account used to run the registry's pod.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
<3> Required to pull the correct image for {product-title}.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called
*docker-registry*. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name
similar to *docker-registry-1-cpty9*.

To see a full list of options that you can specify when creating the registry:

----
$ oc adm registry --help
----
endif::[]

[[registry-daemonset]]
=== Deploying the Registry as a DaemonSet

Use the `oc adm registry` command to deploy the registry as a `DaemonSet` with the
`--daemonset` option.

Daemonsets ensure that when nodes are created, they contain copies of a
specified pod. When the nodes are removed, the pods are garbage collected.

For more information on `DaemonSets`, see
xref:../../dev_guide/daemonsets.adoc#dev-guide-daemonsets[Using DaemonSets].

[[redeploy-registry]]
== Re-deploying the Registry

Since there is a plenty of configuration options for deploying the integrated registry, this
section will try to be as generic as possible and will mention exceptions just for the common
cases. Any invocation of `oc adm registry` command below may be passed additional arguments.

One of the key rules while re-deploying the registry is to never change it's service IP
although it's very easy to do so.

[[maintaining-the-registry-ip-address]]
==== Maintaining the Registry IP Address

{product-title} refers to the integrated registry by its service IP address unless the
xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#setting-the-registry-hostname[internal hostname is
configured]. When the service IP is used, it's the admin's responsibility to preserve it to remain
consistent with internal etcd database. If a custom internal hostname is used, it's still highly
recommended to preserve the service IP whenever the registry is re-deployed.

If you decide to delete and recreate the *docker-registry* service, you can ensure a completely
transparent transition by arranging to re-use the old IP address in the new service. If a new IP
address cannot be avoided, you can minimize cluster disruption by rebooting only the masters.

Why care?::

The internal registry address is used to construct docker image pull-specifications that are used
by {product-title}'s components such us deployer and builder to pull them from the integrated
registry when needed. Moreover, {product-title}'s client tools like `oc adm prune images`
determine the address of the integrated Docker registry from the existing images unless directly
provided.

So if the registry's service IP does not match with the references in image streams and images,
such client tools can misbehave. It also complicates future migration process.

All the example scenarios listed below will stick to this rule.

=== Changing the pod's specification

When only the registry pod specification needs to be changed, all the other registry objects that
are usually created side-by-side with the `docker-registry` DeploymentConfig or DaemonSet
(*deployment* from now on) can be left unchaged. Those are:

- `serviceaccount/registry`
- `service/docker-registry`
- `clusterrolebinding/registry-registry-role`

The registry's behaviour can be easily tuned using environment variables or configuration file as
documented in the
xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#install-config-registry-extended-configuration[extended
registry configuration]. Therefor, there's no need for deleting the existing *deployment*. The
admin can utilize tools like `oc env`, `oc volume`, or `oc edit` to change the existing
*deployment*.

This way, it's easy to roll-back to older working configurations `oc rollout undo ...`.

==== Replacing the Existing *deployment*

In rare cases, it's possible to create a completely new *deployment* from scratch. This can be
achieved like this:

0. Back up the existing *deployment*:
+
====
----
$ oc get -n default -o yaml dc/docker-registry \ <1>
  >dc-docker-registry.yaml
----
<1> Replace `dc` with `ds` if your *deployment* is a DaemonSet. The same applies to the next
command below.
====
+
1. Delete the existing deployment:
+
----
$ oc delete -n default dc/docker-registry
----
+
2. Create a new deployment with `oc adm registry ...`:
+
The command will fail because some objects already exist as the following output illustrates. That
can be ignored because the desired DeploymentConfig has been successfully created.
+
====
----
$ oc adm registry -o json \ <1>
  | oc create -f -
deploymentconfig "docker-registry" created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): serviceaccounts "registry" already exists
Error from server (AlreadyExists): clusterrolebindings "registry-registry-role" already exists
----
<1> Add additional arbitrary arguments as you see fit. Add `*--daemonset*` if you want to deploy
a DaemonSet.
====

=== Changing the service IP

xref:maintaining-the-registry-ip-address[Should be avoided] if possible. However, it can be useful
when the service has been already unintentionally reinstantiated with a different IP while there
are existing objects in the registry. The process is different for the DeploymentConfig and
DaemonSet.

DeploymentConfig::

====
1. Replace the existing service object with new one with the desired cluster IP:
+
----
$ oc expose -n default dc/docker-registry \ <1>
  --session-affinity=ClientIP --cluster-ip=172.30.1.1 <2> \
  -o json --dry-run | \
  oc replace -n default -f - --force <3>
----
+
2. xref:#restart-masters[Restart the masters].
+
3. Restart the registry pods:
+
This is needed unless `*REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR*` is set for the registry services to
reload their internal registry address.
+
----
$ oc rollout latest -n default dc/docker-registry
----

<1> The command produces a specification of the new service named `docker-registry` in the default
namespace for the given DeploymentConfig.
<2> Use the desired IP address instead.
<3> If the service does not exist anymore, change the last line to `oc create -f -`.
====

DaemonSet::

In case of a DaemonSet, its update strategy needs to be first changed to `*RollingUpdate*` so that
pods will be cleanly restarted in a controlled fashion. 

====
1. Set the update strategy to `*RollingUpdate*`:
+
----
$ oc patch -n default ds/docker-registry \
  -p '{"spec":{"updateStrategy":{"type":"RollingUpdate"}}}'
----
+
2. Replace the registry's service:
+
----
$ oc create service clusterip -n default docker-registry --dry-run --tcp=5000:5000 \
  -o json --clusterip=172.30.1.1 | \ <1>
  oc patch -f - --type=json -p '[
      {"op":"add","path":"/spec/sessionAffinity","value":"ClientIP"},
      {"op":"add","path":"/spec/selector","value":{"docker-registry":"default"}}
    ]' --local=true -o json | \
    oc replace -n default -f - --force <2>
----
+
3. xref:#restart-masters[Restart the masters].
+
4. Redeploy the DaemonSet pods in a safe manner by updating the pod spec template:
+
This is needed unless `*REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR*` is set for the registry services to
reload their internal registry address.
+
----
$ oc env -n default ds/docker-registry "TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s%N)"
----

<1> Make sure to choose the right IP address.
<2> If the service does not exist anymore, change the last line to `oc create -f -`.
====

[[restart-masters]]
==== Restart the Masters

The masters cache the internal registry address for their whole lifetime. Unless a
xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#setting-the-registry-hostname[custom internal registry
hostname is set], the masters must be restarted to minimize cluster's disruption:

----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
endif::[]
----
// Code block snarfed from ../http_proxies.adoc, w/ node-reboot stuff removed.
// tnguyen opines: It would be nice to #define this somewhere and include it here...

This ensures that the old registry URL, which includes the old IP address, is cleared from the
cache.

[NOTE]
====
We recommend against rebooting the entire cluster because that incurs unnecessary downtime for
pods and does not actually clear the cache.
====

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[registry-compute-resource]]
== Registry Compute Resources

By default, the registry is created with no settings for
xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[compute resource requests or
limits]. For production, it is highly recommended that the deployment
configuration for the registry be updated to set resource requests and limits
for the registry pod. Otherwise, the registry pod will be considered a
xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#quality-of-service-tiers[*BestEffort*
pod].

See xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[Compute Resources] for more
information on configuring requests and limits.
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

[[storage-for-the-registry]]
== Storage for the Registry

The registry stores container images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with
the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits.
Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.

include::install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc[tag=registry-storage-drivers]

ifdef::atomic-registry[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when re-deploying the registry if the
xref:../../registry_quickstart/administrators/index.adoc#registry-quickstart-administrators-index[quickstart method] was
used. The quickstart method maps the registry service to host ports. This mapping must be updated when the registry is
re-deployed.

----
$ oc patch service docker-registry -p \
     '{ "spec": { "type": "NodePort", "selector": {"docker-registry": "default"},
        "ports": [ {"nodePort": 5000, "port": 5000, "targetPort": 5000}] }}'
----
====
endif::[]

[[registry-production-use]]
=== Production Use

For production use, attach a remote volume or
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[define and use the
persistent storage method of your choice].

For example, to use an existing persistent volume claim:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc \
     --claim-name=<pvc_name> --overwrite
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:registry_known_issues.adoc#install-config-registry-known-issues[Known Issues] if using a scaled registry with a
shared NFS volume.
====

[[registry-amazon-s3-storage-back-end]]
==== Use Amazon S3 as a Storage Back-end

There is also an option to use Amazon Simple Storage Service storage with the
internal Docker registry. It is a secure cloud storage manageable through
link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/[AWS Management Console]. To use
it, the registry's configuration file must be manually edited and mounted to
the registry pod. However, before you start with the configuration, look at
upstream's
link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/configure/config-storage/#amazon-s3[recommended
steps].

Take a xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[default YAML configuration file] as a base and replace the *filesystem* entry in the
*storage* section with *s3* entry such as below. The resulting storage section
may look like this:

====
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  cache:
    layerinfo: inmemory
  delete:
    enabled: true
  s3:
    accesskey: awsaccesskey <1>
    secretkey: awssecretkey <2>
    region: us-west-1
    regionendpoint: http://myobjects.local
    bucket: bucketname
    encrypt: true
    keyid: mykeyid
    secure: true
    v4auth: false
    chunksize: 5242880
    rootdirectory: /s3/object/name/prefix
----
<1> Replace with your Amazon access key.
<2> Replace with your Amazon secret key.
====

All of the *s3* configuration options are documented in upstream's
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/storage-drivers/s3/[driver reference
documentation].

xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[Overriding the registry configuration] will take you through the additional steps on mounting the
configuration file into pod.

[WARNING]
====
When the registry runs on the S3 storage back-end, there are
xref:registry_known_issues.adoc#known-issue-s3-image-push-fails[reported issues].
====

[[registry-non-production-use]]
=== Non-Production Use

For non-production use, you can use the `--mount-host=<path>` option to specify
a directory for the registry to use for persistent storage. The registry volume
is then created as a host-mount at the specified `<path>`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--mount-host` option mounts a directory from the node on which the registry container lives.
If you scale up the *docker-registry* DeploymentConfig, it is possible that your registry pods and
containers will run on different nodes, which can result in two or more registry containers, each
with its own local storage. This will lead to unpredictable behavior, as subsequent requests to
pull the same image repeatedly may not always succeed, depending on which container the request
ultimately goes to.
====

The `--mount-host` option requires that the registry container run in privileged
mode. This is automatically enabled when you specify `--mount-host`.
However, not all pods are allowed to run
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#security-warning[privileged containers] by default.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you still want to use this option, create the registry and specify that it use the *registry* service account that was created during installation:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you still want to use this option:

. Create a new xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account] in
the *default* project for the registry to run as. The following example creates
a service account named *registry*:
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount registry -n default
----

. To add the new *registry* service account in the *default* namespace
to the list of users allowed to run privileged containers:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:registry
----

. Create the registry and specify that it use the new *registry* service
account:
+
----
$ oc adm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc adm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Docker registry pod runs as user *1001*. This user must be able to write to
the host directory. You may need to change directory ownership to user ID *1001*
with this command:

----
$ sudo chown 1001:root <path>
----
====

[[registry-console]]
== Enabling the Registry Console

{product-title} provides a web-based interface to the integrated registry. This
registry console is an optional component for browsing and managing images. It
is deployed as a stateless service running as a pod.

[NOTE]
====
If you installed {product-title} as a
xref:../../install_config/install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[stand-alone registry], the registry console is already deployed and secured automatically
during installation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If Cockpit is already running, you'll need to shut it down before proceeding in
order to avoid a port conflict (9090 by default) with the registry console.
====

[[deploying-the-registry-console]]
=== Deploying the Registry Console

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must first have xref:../../install_config/registry/securing_and_exposing_registry.adoc#exposing-the-registry[exposed the registry].
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Install template in the default namespace
+
----
oc create -n default -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_hosted_templates/files/v1.5/origin/registry-console.yaml
----
+
endif::[]
. Create a passthrough route in the *default* project. You will need this when
creating the registry console application in the next step.
+
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service registry-console \
    --port registry-console \
    -n default
----
+
. Deploy the registry console application. Replace `<openshift_oauth_url>` with
the URL of the {product-title} OAuth provider, which is typically the master.
+
----
$ oc new-app -n default --template=registry-console \
    -p OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_PROVIDER_URL="https://<openshift_oauth_url>:8443" \
    -p REGISTRY_HOST=$(oc get route docker-registry -n default --template='{{ .spec.host }}') \
    -p COCKPIT_KUBE_URL=$(oc get route registry-console -n default --template='https://{{ .spec.host }}')
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the redirection URL is wrong when you are trying to log in to the
registry console, check your OAuth client with `oc get oauthclients`.
====

. Finally, use a web browser to view the console using the route URI.

[[securing-the-registry-console]]
=== Securing the Registry Console

By default, the registry console generates self-signed TLS certificates if
deployed manually per the steps in xref:deploying-the-registry-console[Deploying
the Registry Console]. See xref:registry-console-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting the
Registry Console] for more information.

Use the following steps to add your organization's signed certificates as a
secret volume. This assumes your certificates are available on the `oc`
client host.

. Create a *_.cert_* file containing the certificate and key. Format the file with:
+
- One or more *BEGIN CERTIFICATE* blocks for the server certificate and the intermediate certificate authorities
+
- A block containing a *BEGIN PRIVATE KEY* or similar for the key. The key must not be encrypted
+
For example:
+
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDUzCCAjugAwIBAgIJAPXW+CuNYS6QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMD8xKTAnBgNV
BAoMIGI0OGE2NGNkNmMwNTQ1YThhZTgxOTEzZDE5YmJjMmRjMRIwEAYDVQQDDAls
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDUzCCAjugAwIBAgIJAPXW+CuNYS6QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMD8xKTAnBgNV
BAoMIGI0OGE2NGNkNmMwNTQ1YThhZTgxOTEzZDE5YmJjMmRjMRIwEAYDVQQDDAls
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQCyOJ5garOYw0sm
8TBCDSqQ/H1awGMzDYdB11xuHHsxYS2VepPMzMzryHR137I4dGFLhvdTvJUH8lUS
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
----
+
The registry console loads a certificate from the *_/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d_*
directory. It uses the last file with a *_.cert_* extension in alphabetical
order. Therefore, the *_.cert_* file should contain at least two PEM blocks formatted in the OpenSSL style.
+
If no certificate is found, a self-signed certificate is created using the
`openssl` command and stored in the *_0-self-signed.cert_* file.

. Create the secret:
+
----
$ oc secrets new console-secret \
    /path/to/console.cert
----
+
. Add the secrets to the *registry-console* deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/registry-console --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=console-secret -m /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d
----
+
This triggers a new deployment of the registry console to include your signed
certificates.

[[registry-console-troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting the Registry Console

[[registry-console-debug-mode]]
==== Debug Mode

The registry console debug mode is enabled using an environment variable. The
following command redeploys the registry console in debug mode:

----
$ oc set env dc registry-console G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=cockpit-ws,cockpit-wrapper
----

Enabling debug mode allows more verbose logging to appear in the registry
console's pod logs.


[[registry-console-display-ssl-cert-path]]
==== Display SSL Certificate Path

To check which certificate the registry console is using, a command can be run
from inside the console pod.

. List the pods in the *default* project and find the registry console's pod name:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n default
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
registry-console-1-rssrw   1/1       Running   0          1d
----
+
. Using the pod name from the previous command, get the certificate path that the
*cockpit-ws* process is using. This example shows the console using the
auto-generated certificate:
+
----
$ oc exec registry-console-1-rssrw remotectl certificate
certificate: /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/0-self-signed.cert
----
