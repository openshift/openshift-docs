== Overview

If the integrated registry was not previously deployed automatically during the
initial installation of your {product-title} cluster, or if it is no longer
running successfully and you need to redeploy it on your existing cluster, see
the following sections for options on deploying a new registry.

[NOTE]
====
This topic is not required if you installed a
xref:../../install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[stand-alone registry].
====
endif::[]

[[deploy-registry]]
== Deploying the Registry

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oc adm registry` command from
the *_admin.kubeconfig_* file's location, as a user with cluster administrator
privileges:

----
$ oc adm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --service-account=registry <2>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To deploy the integrated Docker registry, use the `oc adm registry` command as a
user with cluster administrator privileges. For example:

----
$ oc adm registry --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \//<1>
    --service-account=registry \//<2>
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' <3>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
<1> `--config` is the path to the
xref:../../cli_reference/manage_cli_profiles.adoc#cli-reference-manage-cli-profiles[CLI configuration file] for
the xref:../../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster
administrator].
<2> `--service-account` is the service account used to run the registry's pod.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
<3> Required to pull the correct image for {product-title}.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin,openshift-enterprise,openshift-dedicated[]
This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called
*docker-registry*. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name
similar to *docker-registry-1-cpty9*.

To see a full list of options that you can specify when creating the registry:

----
$ oc adm registry --help
----

The value for `--fs-group` must be
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/pod_security_context.adoc#fsgroup[permitted by the SCC]
used by the registry (typically, the restricted SCC).
endif::[]

[[registry-daemonset]]
== Deploying the Registry as a DaemonSet

Use the `oc adm registry` command to deploy the registry as a `DaemonSet` with the
`--daemonset` option.

Daemonsets ensure that when nodes are created, they contain copies of a
specified pod. When the nodes are removed, the pods are garbage collected.

For more information on `DaemonSets`, see
xref:../../dev_guide/daemonsets.adoc#dev-guide-daemonsets[Using Daemonsets].

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
[[registry-compute-resource]]
== Registry Compute Resources

By default, the registry is created with no settings for
xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[compute resource requests or
limits]. For production, it is highly recommended that the deployment
configuration for the registry be updated to set resource requests and limits
for the registry pod. Otherwise, the registry pod will be considered a
xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#quality-of-service-tiers[*BestEffort*
pod].

See xref:../../dev_guide/compute_resources.adoc#dev-guide-compute-resources[Compute Resources] for more
information on configuring requests and limits.
endif::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]

[[storage-for-the-registry]]
== Storage for the Registry

The registry stores container images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with
the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits.
Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.

include::install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc[tag=registry-storage-drivers]

[[registry-production-use]]
=== Production Use

For production use, attach a remote volume or
xref:../../install_config/persistent_storage/index.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-index[define and use the
persistent storage method of your choice].

For example, to use an existing persistent volume claim:

----
$ oc volume deploymentconfigs/docker-registry --add --name=registry-storage -t pvc \
     --claim-name=<pvc_name> --overwrite
----

[NOTE]
====
See xref:registry_known_issues.adoc#install-config-registry-known-issues[Known Issues] if using a scaled registry with a
shared NFS volume.
====

[[registry-amazon-s3-storage-back-end]]
==== Use Amazon S3 as a Storage Back-end

There is also an option to use Amazon Simple Storage Service storage with the
internal Docker registry. It is a secure cloud storage manageable through
link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/getting-started/[AWS Management Console]. To use
it, the registry's configuration file must be manually edited and mounted to
the registry pod. However, before you start with the configuration, look at
upstream's
link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/configure/config-storage/#amazon-s3[recommended
steps].

Take a xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[default YAML configuration file] as a base and replace the *filesystem* entry in the
*storage* section with *s3* entry such as below. The resulting storage section
may look like this:

====
[source,yaml]
----
storage:
  cache:
    layerinfo: inmemory
  delete:
    enabled: true
  s3:
    accesskey: awsaccesskey <1>
    secretkey: awssecretkey <2>
    region: us-west-1
    regionendpoint: http://myobjects.local
    bucket: bucketname
    encrypt: true
    keyid: mykeyid
    secure: true
    v4auth: false
    chunksize: 5242880
    rootdirectory: /s3/object/name/prefix
----
<1> Replace with your Amazon access key.
<2> Replace with your Amazon secret key.
====

All of the *s3* configuration options are documented in upstream's
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/storage-drivers/s3/[driver reference
documentation].

xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[Overriding the registry configuration] will take you through the additional steps on mounting the
configuration file into pod.

[WARNING]
====
When the registry runs on the S3 storage back-end, there are
xref:registry_known_issues.adoc#known-issue-s3-image-push-fails[reported issues].
====

[[registry-non-production-use]]
=== Non-Production Use

For non-production use, you can use the `--mount-host=<path>` option to specify
a directory for the registry to use for persistent storage. The registry volume
is then created as a host-mount at the specified `<path>`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `--mount-host` option mounts a directory from the node on which the registry
container lives. If you scale up the *docker-registry* deployment configuration,
it is possible that your registry pods and containers will run on different
nodes, which can result in two or more registry containers, each with its own
local storage. This will lead to unpredictable behavior, as subsequent requests
to pull the same image repeatedly may not always succeed, depending on which
container the request ultimately goes to.
====

The `--mount-host` option requires that the registry container run in privileged
mode. This is automatically enabled when you specify `--mount-host`.
However, not all pods are allowed to run
xref:../../install/prerequisites.adoc#security-warning[privileged containers] by default.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you still want to use this option, create the registry and specify that it use the *registry* service account that was created during installation:
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
If you still want to use this option:

. Create a new xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account] in
the *default* project for the registry to run as. The following example creates
a service account named *registry*:
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount registry -n default
----

. To add the new *registry* service account in the *default* namespace
to the list of users allowed to run privileged containers:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:registry
----

. Create the registry and specify that it use the new *registry* service
account:
+
----
$ oc adm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
$ oc adm registry --service-account=registry \
    --config=/etc/origin/master/admin.kubeconfig \
    --images='registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose-${component}:${version}' \
    --mount-host=<path>
----
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Docker registry pod runs as user *1001*. This user must be able to write to
the host directory. You may need to change directory ownership to user ID *1001*
with this command:

----
$ sudo chown 1001:root <path>
----
====

[[registry-console]]
== Enabling the Registry Console

{product-title} provides a web-based interface to the integrated registry. This
registry console is an optional component for browsing and managing images. It
is deployed as a stateless service running as a pod.

[NOTE]
====
If you installed {product-title} as a
xref:../../install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[stand-alone registry], the registry console is already deployed and secured automatically
during installation.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If Cockpit is already running, you'll need to shut it down before proceeding in
order to avoid a port conflict (9090 by default) with the registry console.
====

[[deploying-the-registry-console]]
=== Deploying the Registry Console

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must first have xref:../../install_config/registry/securing_and_exposing_registry.adoc#exposing-the-registry[exposed the registry].
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
. Install template in the default namespace
+
----
oc create -n default -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/openshift-ansible/master/roles/openshift_hosted_templates/files/v1.5/origin/registry-console.yaml
----
+
endif::[]
. Create a passthrough route in the *default* project. You will need this when
creating the registry console application in the next step.
+
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service registry-console \
    --port registry-console \
    -n default
----
+
. Deploy the registry console application. Replace `<openshift_oauth_url>` with
the URL of the {product-title} OAuth provider, which is typically the master.
+
----
$ oc new-app -n default --template=registry-console \
    -p OPENSHIFT_OAUTH_PROVIDER_URL="https://<openshift_oauth_url>:8443" \
    -p REGISTRY_HOST=$(oc get route docker-registry -n default --template='{{ .spec.host }}') \
    -p COCKPIT_KUBE_URL=$(oc get route registry-console -n default --template='https://{{ .spec.host }}')
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If the redirection URL is wrong when you are trying to log in to the
registry console, check your OAuth client with `oc get oauthclients`.
====

. Finally, use a web browser to view the console using the route URI.

[[securing-the-registry-console]]
=== Securing the Registry Console

By default, the registry console generates self-signed TLS certificates if
deployed manually per the steps in xref:deploying-the-registry-console[Deploying
the Registry Console]. See xref:registry-console-troubleshooting[Troubleshooting the
Registry Console] for more information.

Use the following steps to add your organization's signed certificates as a
secret volume. This assumes your certificates are available on the `oc`
client host.

. Create a *_.cert_* file containing the certificate and key. Format the file with:
+
- One or more *BEGIN CERTIFICATE* blocks for the server certificate and the intermediate certificate authorities
+
- A block containing a *BEGIN PRIVATE KEY* or similar for the key. The key must not be encrypted
+
For example:
+
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDUzCCAjugAwIBAgIJAPXW+CuNYS6QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMD8xKTAnBgNV
BAoMIGI0OGE2NGNkNmMwNTQ1YThhZTgxOTEzZDE5YmJjMmRjMRIwEAYDVQQDDAls
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDUzCCAjugAwIBAgIJAPXW+CuNYS6QMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMD8xKTAnBgNV
BAoMIGI0OGE2NGNkNmMwNTQ1YThhZTgxOTEzZDE5YmJjMmRjMRIwEAYDVQQDDAls
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQCyOJ5garOYw0sm
8TBCDSqQ/H1awGMzDYdB11xuHHsxYS2VepPMzMzryHR137I4dGFLhvdTvJUH8lUS
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
----
+
- The secured registry should contain the following Subject Alternative Names (SAN) list:
+
* Two service hostnames.
+
For example:
+
----
docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local
docker-registry.default.svc
----
+
* Service IP address.
+
For example:
+
----
172.30.124.220
----
+
Use the following command to get the Docker registry service IP address:
+
----
oc get service docker-registry --template='{{.spec.clusterIP}}'
----
+
* Public hostname.
+
For example:
+
----
docker-registry-default.apps.example.com
----
+
Use the following command to get the Docker registry public hostname:
+
----
oc get route docker-registry --template '{{.spec.host}}'
----
+
For example, the server certificate should contain SAN details similar to the following:
+
----
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
               DNS:docker-registry-public.openshift.com, DNS:docker-registry.default.svc, DNS:docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local, DNS:172.30.2.98, IP Address:172.30.2.98
----
+
The registry console loads a certificate from the *_/etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d_*
directory. It uses the last file with a *_.cert_* extension in alphabetical
order. Therefore, the *_.cert_* file should contain at least two PEM blocks formatted in the OpenSSL style.
+
If no certificate is found, a self-signed certificate is created using the
`openssl` command and stored in the *_0-self-signed.cert_* file.

. Create the secret:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic console-secret \
    --from-file=/path/to/console.cert
----
+
. Add the secrets to the *registry-console* deployment configuration:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/registry-console --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=console-secret -m /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d
----
+
This triggers a new deployment of the registry console to include your signed
certificates.

[[registry-console-troubleshooting]]
=== Troubleshooting the Registry Console

[[registry-console-debug-mode]]
==== Debug Mode

The registry console debug mode is enabled using an environment variable. The
following command redeploys the registry console in debug mode:

----
$ oc set env dc registry-console G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=cockpit-ws,cockpit-wrapper
----

Enabling debug mode allows more verbose logging to appear in the registry
console's pod logs.


[[registry-console-display-ssl-cert-path]]
==== Display SSL Certificate Path

To check which certificate the registry console is using, a command can be run
from inside the console pod.

. List the pods in the *default* project and find the registry console's pod name:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n default
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
registry-console-1-rssrw   1/1       Running   0          1d
----
+
. Using the pod name from the previous command, get the certificate path that the
*cockpit-ws* process is using. This example shows the console using the
auto-generated certificate:
+
----
$ oc exec registry-console-1-rssrw remotectl certificate
certificate: /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d/0-self-signed.cert
----
