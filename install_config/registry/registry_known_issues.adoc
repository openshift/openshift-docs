== Overview

The following are the known issues when deploying or using the integrated
registry.

[[known-issue-nfs-image-push-fails]]
== Image Push Errors with Scaled Registry Using Shared NFS Volume

When using a scaled registry with a shared NFS volume, you may see one of the
following errors during the push of an image:

- `digest invalid: provided digest did not match uploaded content`
- `blob upload unknown`
- `blob upload invalid`

These errors are returned by an internal registry service when Docker attempts
to push the image. Its cause originates in the synchronization of file
attributes across nodes. Factors such as NFS client side caching, network
latency, and layer size can all contribute to potential errors that might occur
when pushing an image using the default round-robin load balancing
configuration.

You can perform the following steps to minimize the probability of such a
failure:

. Ensure that the `*sessionAffinity*` of your *docker-registry* service is set
to `ClientIP`:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry --template='{{.spec.sessionAffinity}}'
----
+
This should return `ClientIP`, which is the default in recent {product-title}
versions. If not, change it:
+
----
$ oc patch svc/docker-registry -p '{"spec":{"sessionAffinity": "ClientIP"}}'
----
+
. Ensure that the NFS export line of your registry volume on your NFS server has
the `no_wdelay` options listed. The `no_wdelay` option prevents the server from
delaying writes, which greatly improves read-after-write consistency, a
requirement of the registry.

[NOTE]
====
The guidelines for NFS are recommended to help you get started. You
may switch off from NFS when moving to production.

== Pull of Internally Managed Image Fails with "not found" Error

This error occurs when the pulled image is pushed to an image stream different
from the one it is being pulled from. This is caused by re-tagging a built image into an arbitrary image stream:

====
----
$ oc tag srcimagestream:latest anyproject/pullimagestream:latest
----

And subsequently pulling from it, using an image reference such as:

----
internal.registry.url:5000/anyproject/pullimagestream:latest
----
====

During a manual Docker pull, this will produce a similar error:

====
----
Error: image anyproject/pullimagestream:latest not found
----
====

To prevent this, avoid the tagging of internally managed images completely, or
re-push the built image to the desired namespace
xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-pushing-and-pulling-images[manually].

[[known-issue-s3-image-push-fails]]
== Image Push Fails with "500 Internal Server Error" on S3 Storage

There are problems reported happening when the registry runs on S3 storage
back-end. Pushing to a Docker registry occasionally fails with the following
error:

----
Received unexpected HTTP status: 500 Internal Server Error
----

To debug this, you need to xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#registry-viewing-logs[view the registry logs]. In there,
look for similar error messages occurring at the time of the failed push:

----
time="2016-03-30T15:01:21.22287816-04:00" level=error msg="unknown error completing upload: driver.Error{DriverName:\"s3\", Enclosed:(*url.Error)(0xc20901cea0)}" http.request.method=PUT
...

If you see such errors, contact your Amazon S3 support. There may be a
problem in your region or with your particular bucket.

[[known-issue-prune-fails-due-to-delete-disabled]]
== Image Pruning Fails

If you encounter the following error when pruning images:

----
BLOB sha256:49638d540b2b62f3b01c388e9d8134c55493b1fa659ed84e97cb59b87a6b8e6c error deleting blob
----

And your xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#registry-viewing-logs[registry log] contains the following information:

----
error deleting blob \"sha256:49638d540b2b62f3b01c388e9d8134c55493b1fa659ed84e97cb59b87a6b8e6c\": operation unsupported
----

It means that your xref:../../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[custom configuration file] lacks mandatory entries in the
xref:../../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#docker-registry-configuration-reference-storage[storage section], namely
`*storage:delete:enabled*` set to *true*. Add them, re-deploy the registry, and
repeat your image pruning operation.

== Registry fails to deploy

If the docker-registry pod fails to run and you see either the following error or no error at all.
Verify that the corresponding service object exists.

----
$ oc get pods -n default -l docker-registry=default
NAME                            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
docker-registry-2-l75vp         0/1       Error       4          1h
$ oc logs -n default docker-registry-2-l75vp
time="2018-04-10T08:01:38Z" level=fatal msg="error parsing configuration file: configuration error in openshift.server.addr: REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR variable must be set when running outside of Kubernetes cluster"
$ oc describe svc/docker-registry
Error from server (NotFound): services "docker-registry" not found
----

If it does not (like in the example above), create a new one according to
xref:deploy_registry_existing_clusters.adoc#fix-service-ip[re-deploying the registry guide].

The registry first attempts to determine its own internal address from the
`${REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR}` environment variable. If unset, it will fall-back to
`${DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_HOST}:${DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_PORT}` environment variables that are
inherited from the associated service object as long as it exists.

Additionally, it's recommended to set the `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR` as well. Please refer
to xref:extended_registry_configuration.adoc#setting-the-registry-hostname[Setting the Registry
Hostname] for more information.
