== Overview

The following are the known issues when deploying or using the integrated
registry.

[[known-issue-docker-registry-additional-load]]
== Concurrent Build with Registry Pull-through

The local *docker-registry* deployment takes on additional load. By default, it
now caches content from *_registry.access.redhat.com_*. The images from
*_registry.access.redhat.com_* for STI builds are now stored in the local
registry. Attempts to pull them result in pulls from the local
*docker-registry*. As a result, there are circumstances where extreme numbers of
concurrent builds can result in timeouts for the pulls and the build can
possibly fail. To alleviate the issue, scale the *docker-registry* deployment to
more than one replica. Check for timeouts in the builder pod's logs.

[[known-issue-nfs-image-push-fails]]
== Image Push Errors with Scaled Registry Using Shared NFS Volume

When using a scaled registry with a shared NFS volume, you may see one of the
following errors during the push of an image:

- `digest invalid: provided digest did not match uploaded content`
- `blob upload unknown`
- `blob upload invalid`

These errors are returned by an internal registry service when Docker attempts
to push the image. Its cause originates in the synchronization of file
attributes across nodes. Factors such as NFS client side caching, network
latency, and layer size can all contribute to potential errors that might occur
when pushing an image using the default round-robin load balancing
configuration.

You can perform the following steps to minimize the probability of such a
failure:

. Ensure that the `*sessionAffinity*` of your *docker-registry* service is set
to `ClientIP`:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry --template='{{.spec.sessionAffinity}}'
----
+
This should return `ClientIP`, which is the default in recent {product-title}
versions. If not, change it:
+
----
$ oc patch svc/docker-registry -p '{"spec":{"sessionAffinity": "ClientIP"}}'
----
+
. Ensure that the NFS export line of your registry volume on your NFS server has
the `no_wdelay` options listed. The `no_wdelay` option prevents the server from
delaying writes, which greatly improves read-after-write consistency, a
requirement of the registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testing has shown issues with using the NFS server on RHEL as storage backend for the container registry. This includes the embedded registry and Quay, Cassandra for metrics storage, and ElasticSearch for logging storage. Therefore, using NFS on RHEL as storage for these framework services is not recommended.

Other NFS implementations on the marketplace may not have these issues. Please contact the individual NFS implementation vendor for more information on any testing they may have performed against these OpenShift framework components.

== Pull of Internally Managed Image Fails with "not found" Error

This error occurs when the pulled image is pushed to an image stream different
from the one it is being pulled from. This is caused by re-tagging a built image into an arbitrary image stream:

====
----
$ oc tag srcimagestream:latest anyproject/pullimagestream:latest
----

And subsequently pulling from it, using an image reference such as:

----
internal.registry.url:5000/anyproject/pullimagestream:latest
----
====

During a manual Docker pull, this will produce a similar error:

====
----
Error: image anyproject/pullimagestream:latest not found
----
====

To prevent this, avoid the tagging of internally managed images completely, or
re-push the built image to the desired namespace
xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#access-pushing-and-pulling-images[manually].

[[known-issue-s3-image-push-fails]]
== Image Push Fails with "500 Internal Server Error" on S3 Storage

There are problems reported happening when the registry runs on S3 storage
back-end. Pushing to a Docker registry occasionally fails with the following
error:

----
Received unexpected HTTP status: 500 Internal Server Error
----

To debug this, you need to xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#registry-viewing-logs[view the registry logs]. In there,
look for similar error messages occurring at the time of the failed push:

----
time="2016-03-30T15:01:21.22287816-04:00" level=error msg="unknown error completing upload: driver.Error{DriverName:\"s3\", Enclosed:(*url.Error)(0xc20901cea0)}" http.request.method=PUT
...

If you see such errors, contact your Amazon S3 support. There may be a
problem in your region or with your particular bucket.

[[known-issue-prune-fails-due-to-delete-disabled]]
== Image Pruning Fails

If you encounter the following error when pruning images:

----
BLOB sha256:49638d540b2b62f3b01c388e9d8134c55493b1fa659ed84e97cb59b87a6b8e6c error deleting blob
----

And your xref:../../install_config/registry/accessing_registry.adoc#registry-viewing-logs[registry log] contains the following information:

----
error deleting blob \"sha256:49638d540b2b62f3b01c388e9d8134c55493b1fa659ed84e97cb59b87a6b8e6c\": operation unsupported
----

It means that your xref:../../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration[custom configuration file] lacks mandatory entries in the
xref:../../install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc#docker-registry-configuration-reference-storage[storage section], namely
`*storage:delete:enabled*` set to *true*. Add them, re-deploy the registry, and
repeat your image pruning operation.
