[[maintaining-the-registry-ip-address]]
== Maintaining the Registry IP Address

{product-title} refers to the integrated registry by its service IP address,
so if you decide to delete and recreate the *docker-registry* service,
you can ensure a completely transparent transition by arranging to
re-use the old IP address in the new service.
If a new IP address cannot be avoided, you can minimize cluster
disruption by rebooting only the masters.

[[re-using-the-address]]
Re-using the Address::

To re-use the IP address, you must save the IP address of the old *docker-registry*
service prior to deleting it, and arrange to replace the newly assigned IP address
with the saved one in the new *docker-registry* service.

// NB: Snarfed from <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/1494>.
. Make a note of the `clusterIP` for the service:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry -o yaml | grep clusterIP:
----

. Delete the service:
+
----
$ oc delete svc/docker-registry dc/docker-registry
----

. Create the registry definition in *_registry.yaml_*, replacing `<options>`
with, for example, those used in step 3 of the instructions in the
xref:registry-non-production-use[Non-Production Use] section:
+
----
$ oc adm registry <options> -o yaml > registry.yaml
----

. Edit *_registry.yaml_*, find the `Service` there,
and change its `clusterIP` to the address noted in step 1.

. Create the registry using the modified *_registry.yaml_*:
+
----
$ oc create -f registry.yaml
----

[[rebooting-the-masters]]
Rebooting the Masters::

If you are unable to re-use the IP address, any operation that uses a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[pull specification]
that includes the old IP address will fail.
To minimize cluster disruption, you must reboot the masters:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master-api origin-master-controllers
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api atomic-openshift-master-controllers
endif::[]
----
// Code block snarfed from ../http_proxies.adoc, w/ node-reboot stuff removed.
// tnguyen opines: It would be nice to #define this somewhere and include it here...
+
This ensures that the old registry URL, which includes the old IP address,
is cleared from the cache.
+
[NOTE]
We recommend against rebooting the entire cluster because that incurs
unnecessary downtime for pods and does not actually clear the cache.


[[whitelisting-docker-registries]]
== Whitelisting Docker Registries

You can specify a whitelist of docker registries, allowing you to curate a set
of images and templates that are available for download by {product-title}
users. This curated set can be placed in one or more docker registries, and then
added to the whitelist. When using a whitelist, only the specified registries
are accessible within {product-title}, and all other registries are denied
access by default.

To configure a whitelist:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to block all registries:
+
----
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----
+
You may need to uncomment the `*BLOCK_REGISTRY*` line.
. In the same file, add registries to which you want to allow access:
+
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=<registry1> --add-registry=<registry2>'
----
+
.Allowing Access to Registries
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=registry.access.redhat.com'
----
+
This example would restrict access to images available on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/search/#/container-images[Red Hat Customer Portal].

Once the whitelist is configured, if a user tries to pull from a docker registry
that is not on the whitelist, they will receive an error message stating that
this registry is not allowed.

[[setting-the-registry-hostname]]
== Setting the Registry Hostname

You can configure the hostname and port the registry is known by for both internal and external references.
By doing this, image streams will provide hostname based push and pull specifications for images,
allowing consumers of the images to be isolated from changes to the registry service ip and potentially
allowing image streams and their references to be portable between clusters.

To set the hostname used to reference the registry from within the cluster, set the `internalRegistryHostname`
in the `imagePolicyConfig` section of the master configuration file.  The external hostname is controlled by setting the `externalRegistryHostname` value in the same location.

.Image Policy Configuration
[source,yaml]
----
imagePolicyConfig:
  internalRegistryHostname: docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:5000
  externalRegistryHostname: docker-registry.mycompany.com
----

The registry itself must be configured with the same internal hostname value.  This can be accomplished by setting the
`*REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR*` environment variable on the registry deployment configuration,
or by setting the value in the xref:extended_registry_configuration#docker-registry-configuration-reference-openshift[OpenShift section] of the registry configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If you have enabled TLS for your registry the server certificate must
include the hostnames by which you expect the registry to be referenced.
See xref:securing_and_exposing_registry.adoc#securing-the-registry[securing
the registry] for instructions on adding hostnames to the server certificate.
====

[[advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration]]
== Overriding the Registry Configuration

You can override the integrated registry's default configuration, found by
default at *_/config.yml_* in a running registry's container, with your own
xref:registry-configuration-reference[custom configuration].

[NOTE]
====
Upstream configuration options in this file may also be overridden using
environment variables. The
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[middleware section] is
an exception as there are just a few options that can be overridden using
environment variables.

        blobrepositorycachettl: 10m <7>
  storage:
    - name: openshift <1>
----
<1> These entries are mandatory. Their presence ensures required components are
loaded. These values should not be changed.
<2> Allows you to store
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-2[manifest
schema v2] during a push to the registry. See
xref:middleware-repository-acceptschema2[below] for more details.
<3> Allows the registry to act as a proxy for remote blobs. See
xref:middleware-repository-pullthrough[below] for more details.
<4> Allows the registry cache blobs to be served from remote registries for fast
access later. The mirroring starts when the blob is accessed for the first time.
The option has no effect if the
xref:middleware-repository-pullthrough[pullthrough] is disabled.
<5> Prevents blob uploads exceeding the size limit, which are defined in the
targeted project.
<6> An expiration timeout for limits cached in the registry. The lower the
value, the less time it takes for the limit changes to propagate to the
registry. However, the registry will query limits from the server more
frequently and, as a consequence, pushes will be slower.
<7> An expiration timeout for remembered associations between blob and
repository. The higher the value, the higher probability of fast lookup and
more efficient registry operation. On the other hand, memory usage will raise
as well as a risk of serving image layer to user, who is no longer authorized
to access it.

[[middleware-cloudfront]]
==== CloudFront Middleware
The link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#cloudfront[*CloudFront*
middleware extension] can be added to support AWS, CloudFront CDN storage
provider. CloudFront middleware speeds up distribution of image content
internationally. The blobs are distributed to several edge locations around the
world. The client is always directed to the edge with the lowest latency.

[NOTE]
====
The link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#cloudfront[*CloudFront*
middleware extension] can be only used with
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/storage-drivers/s3/[S3] storage.
It is utilized only during blob serving. Therefore, only blob downloads can be
speeded up, not uploads.
====

The following is an example of minimal configuration of S3 storage driver with a
CloudFront middleware:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 0.1

----
<1> The S3 storage must be configured the same way regardless of CloudFront
middleware.
<2> The CloudFront storage middleware needs to be listed before OpenShift
middleware.
<3> The CloudFront base URL. In the AWS management console, this is listed as
*Domain Name* of CloudFront distribution.
<4> The location of your AWS private key on the filesystem. This must be not
confused with Amazon EC2 key pair. Please refer to

documentation] on creating CloudFront key pairs for your trusted signers. The
file needs to be mounted as a xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret] into the registry
pod.
<5> The ID of your Cloudfront key pair.

[[middleware-overriding]]
==== Overriding Middleware Configuration Options
The *middleware* section cannot be overridden using environment variables.
There are a few exceptions, however. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        acceptschema2: true <1>
        pullthrough: true <2>
        mirrorpullthrough: true <3>
        enforcequota: false <4>
        projectcachettl: 1m <5>
        blobrepositorycachettl: 10m <6>
----
<1> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ACCEPTSCHEMA2`, which
allows for the ability to accept manifest schema v2 on manifest put requests.
Recognized values are `true` and `false` (which applies to all the other
boolean variables below).
<2> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_PULLTHROUGH`, which
enables a proxy mode for remote repositories.
<3> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_MIRRORPULLTHROUGH`, which
instructs registry to mirror blobs locally if serving remote blobs.
<4> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA`, which
allows the ability to turn quota enforcement on or off. By default, quota
enforcement is off.
<5> A configuration option that can be overridden by the environment variable
`REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_PROJECTCACHETTL`, specifying an
eviction timeout for project quota objects. It takes a valid time duration
string (for example, `2m`). If empty, you get the default timeout. If zero
(`0m`), caching is disabled.
<6> A configuration option that can be overridden by the environment variable
`REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_BLOBREPOSITORYCACHETTL`, specifying
an eviction timeout for associations between blob and containing repository.
The format of the value is the same as in `projectcachettl` case.

[[middleware-repository-pullthrough]]
==== Image Pullthrough

If enabled, the registry will attempt to fetch requested blob from a remote
registry unless the blob exists locally. The remote candidates are calculated
from **DockerImage** entries stored in status of the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream], a client pulls from. All the unique remote registry references in
such entries will be tried in turn until the blob is found.

Pullthrough will only occur if an image stream tag exists for the image being
pulled. For example, if the image being pulled is
`*docker-registry.default.svc:5000/yourproject/yourimage:prod*` then the
registry will look for an image stream tag named `*yourimage:prod*` in the
project `*yourproject*`. If it finds one, it will attempt to pull the image
using the `*dockerImageReference*` associated with that image stream tag.

When performing pullthrough, the registry will use pull credentials found in the
project associated with the image stream tag that is being referenced. This
capability also makes it possible for you to pull images that reside on a
registry they do not have credentials to access, as long as you have access
to the image stream tag that references the image.

Note that by default image stream tags use a reference policy type of `*Source*`
which means that when the image stream reference is resolved to an image pull
specification, the specification used will point to the source of the image.
For images hosted on external registries, this will be the external registry and
as a result the resource will reference and pull the image by the external
registry. For example, `*registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/jenkins-2-rhel7*` and
pullthrough will not apply. To ensure that resources referencing image streams
use a pull specification that points to the internal registry, the image stream
tag should use a reference policy type of `*Local*`. More information is available on
xref:../../dev_guide/managing_images.adoc#reference-policy[Reference Policy].

This feature is on by default. However, it can be disabled using a
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[configuration option].

By default, all the remote blobs served this way are stored locally for
subsequent faster access unless `mirrorpullthrough` is disabled. The downside
of this mirroring feature is an increased storage usage.

[NOTE]
====
The mirroring starts when a client tries to fetch at least a single byte of the
blob. To pre-fetch a particular image into integrated registry before it is
actually needed, you can run the following command:

----
$ oc get imagestreamtag/${IS}:${TAG} -o jsonpath='{ .image.dockerImageLayers[*].name }' | \
  xargs -n1 -I {} curl -H "Range: bytes=0-1" -u user:${TOKEN} \
  http://${REGISTRY_IP}:${PORT}/v2/default/mysql/blobs/{}
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This {product-title} mirroring feature should not be confused with the upstream
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/[registry pull through cache feature],
which is a similar but distinct capability.
====


[[middleware-repository-acceptschema2]]
==== Manifest Schema v2 Support

Each image has a manifest describing its blobs, instructions for running it
and additional metadata. The manifest is versioned, with each version having different
structure and fields as it evolves over time. The same image can be represented
by multiple manifest versions. Each version will have different digest though.

The registry currently supports
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-1[manifest
v2 schema 1] (*schema1*) and
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-2[manifest
v2 schema 2] (*schema2*). The former is being obsoleted but will be supported
for an extended amount of time.

You should be wary of compatibility issues with various Docker clients:

- Docker clients of version 1.9 or older support only *schema1*. Any manifest
this client pulls or pushes will be of this legacy schema.
- Docker clients of version 1.10 support both *schema1* and *schema2*. And by default, it will
push the latter to the registry if it supports newer schema.

The registry, storing an image with *schema1* will always return it unchanged
to the client. *Schema2* will be transferred unchanged only to newer Docker
client. For the older one, it will be converted on-the-fly to *schema1*.

This has significant consequences. For example an image pushed to the registry
by a newer Docker client cannot be pulled by the older Docker by its digest.
That's because the stored image's manifest is of *schema2* and its digest can
be used to pull only this version of manifest.

For this reason, the registry is configured by default not to store *schema2*.
This ensures that any docker client will be able to pull from the registry any
image pushed there regardless of client's version.

Once you're confident that all the registry clients support *schema2*, you'll
be safe to enable its support in the registry. See the
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[middleware
configuration reference] above for particular option.

[[docker-registry-configuration-reference-openshift]]
=== OpenShift

This section reviews the configuration of global settings for features specific
to {product-title}. In a future release, `openshift`-related settings in the
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[Middleware] section will

<3> Can be set to `true` to enable metrics collection. It can be overridden by the boolean
environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_METRICS_ENABLED`.
<4> A secret used to authorize client requests. Metrics clients must use it as a
bearer token in `Authorization` header. It can be overridden by the environment
variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_METRICS_SECRET`.
<5> Maximum number of simultaneous pull requests.  It can be overridden by the
environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_REQUESTS_READ_MAXRUNNING`.  Zero indicates no limit.
<6> Maximum number of queued pull requests.  It can be overridden by the
environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_REQUESTS_READ_MAXINQUEUE`.  Zero indicates no limit.
<7> Maximum time a pull request can wait in the queue before being rejected.
It can be overridden by the environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_REQUESTS_READ_MAXWAITINQUEUE`.
Zero indicates no limit.
<8> Maximum number of simultaneous push requests.  It can be overridden by the
environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_REQUESTS_WRITE_MAXRUNNING`.  Zero indicates no limit.
<9> Maximum number of queued push requests.  It can be overridden by the
environment variable `REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_REQUESTS_WRITE_MAXINQUEUE`.  Zero indicates no limit.
<10> Maximum time a push request can wait in the queue before being rejected.  It can be overridden by the

are supported. The registry deployment configuration provides an integrated
health check at */healthz*.

[[docker-registry-configuration-reference-proxy]]
=== Proxy

Proxy configuration should not be enabled. This functionality is provided by
the xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[{product-title}
repository middleware extension], *pullthrough: true*.

[[docker-registry-configuration-reference-cache]]
=== Cache

The integrated registry actively caches data to reduce the number of calls to
slow external resources. There are two caches:

. The storage cache that is used to cache blobs metadata. This cache does not
have an expiration time and the data is there until it is explicitly deleted.

. The application cache contains association between blobs and repositories.
The data in this cache has an expiration time.

In order to completely turn off the cache, you need to change the configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 0.1
log:
  level: debug
http:
  addr: :5000
storage:
  cache: {} <1>
openshift:
  version: 1.0
  cache:
    disabled: true <2>
    blobrepositoryttl: 10m
----

<1> Disables cache of metadata accessed in the storage backend. Without this
cache, the registry server will constantly access the backend for metadata.
<2> Disables the cache in which contains the blob and repository associations.
Without this cache, the registry server will continually re-query the data from
the master API and recompute the associations.
