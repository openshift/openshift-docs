[[maintaining-the-registry-ip-address]]
== Maintaining the Registry IP Address

{product-title} refers to the integrated registry by its service IP address,
so if you decide to delete and recreate the *docker-registry* service,
you can ensure a completely transparent transition by arranging to
re-use the old IP address in the new service.
If a new IP address cannot be avoided, you can minimize cluster
disruption by rebooting only the masters.

[[re-using-the-address]]
Re-using the Address::

To re-use the IP address, you must save the IP address of the old *docker-registry*
service prior to deleting it, and arrange to replace the newly assigned IP address
with the saved one in the new *docker-registry* service.

// NB: Snarfed from <https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/issues/1494>.
. Make a note of the `ClusterIP` for the service:
+
----
$ oc get svc/docker-registry -o yaml | grep clusterIP:
----

. Delete the service:
+
----
$ oc delete svc/docker-registry dc/docker-registry
----

. Create the registry definition in *_registry.yaml_*, replacing `<options>`
with, for example, those used in step 3 of the instructions in the
xref:registry-non-production-use[Non-Production Use] section:
+
----
$ oadm registry <options> -o yaml > registry.yaml
----

. Edit *_registry.yaml_*, find the `Service` there,
and change its `ClusterIP` to the address noted in step 1.

. Create the registry using the modified *_registry.yaml_*:
+
----
$ oc create -f registry.yaml
----

[[rebooting-the-masters]]
Rebooting the Masters::

If you are unable to re-use the IP address, any operation that uses a xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[pull specification]
that includes the old IP address will fail.
To minimize cluster disruption, you must reboot the masters:
+
----
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
# systemctl restart origin-master
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
endif::[]
----
// Code block snarfed from ../http_proxies.adoc, w/ node-reboot stuff removed.
// tnguyen opines: It would be nice to #define this somewhere and include it here...
+
This ensures that the old registry URL, which includes the old IP address,
is cleared from the cache.
+
[NOTE]
We recommend against rebooting the entire cluster because that incurs
unnecessary downtime for pods and does not actually clear the cache.


[[whitelisting-docker-registries]]
== Whitelisting Docker Registries

You can specify a whitelist of docker registries, allowing you to curate a set
of images and templates that are available for download by {product-title}
users. This curated set can be placed in one or more docker registries, and then
added to the whitelist. When using a whitelist, only the specified registries
are accessible within {product-title}, and all other registries are denied
access by default.

To configure a whitelist:

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file to block all registries:
+
----
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----
+
You may need to uncomment the `*BLOCK_REGISTRY*` line.
. In the same file, add registries to which you want to allow access:
+
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=<registry1> --add-registry=<registry2>'
----
+
.Allowing Access to Registries
====
----
ADD_REGISTRY='--add-registry=registry.access.redhat.com'
----
====
+
This example would restrict access to images available on the
link:https://access.redhat.com/search/#/container-images[Red Hat Customer Portal].

Once the whitelist is configured, if a user tries to pull from a docker registry
that is not on the whitelist, they will receive an error message stating that
this registry is not allowed.

[[advanced-overriding-the-registry-configuration]]
== Overriding the Registry Configuration

You can override the integrated registry's default configuration, found by
default at *_/config.yml_* in a running registry's container, with your own
xref:registry-configuration-reference[custom configuration].

[NOTE]
====
Upstream configuration options in this file may also be overridden using
environment variables. The
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[middleware section] is
an exception as there are just a few options that can be overridden using
environment variables.
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#override-specific-configuration-options[Learn
how to override specific configuration options].
====

To enable management of the registry configuration file directly and deploy an updated configuration, mount the
configuration file as a xref:../../dev_guide/secrets.adoc#dev-guide-secrets[secret volume]:

. xref:deploy-registry[Deploy the registry].

. Edit the registry configuration file locally as needed. The initial YAML file
deployed on the registry is provided below.

----
====

. Create a new secret called *registry-config* from your custom registry
configuration file you edited locally:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----

. Add the *registry-config* secret as a volume to the registry's deployment
configuration to mount the custom configuration file at
*_/etc/docker/registry/_*:
+
----
$ oc volume dc/docker-registry --add --type=secret \
    --secret-name=registry-config -m /etc/docker/registry/
----
+
. Update the registry to reference the configuration path from the previous step
by adding the following environment variable to the registry's deployment
configuration:
+
----
$ oc env dc/docker-registry \
    REGISTRY_CONFIGURATION_PATH=/etc/docker/registry/config.yml
----

This may be performed as an iterative process to achieve the desired
configuration. For example, during troubleshooting, the configuration may be
temporarily updated to put it in *debug* mode.

To update an existing configuration:

[WARNING]
====
This procedure will overwrite the currently deployed registry configuration.
====

. Edit the local registry configuration file, *_config.yml_*.

. Delete the *registry-config* secret:
+
----
$ oc delete secret registry-config
----
+
. Recreate the secret to reference the updated configuration file:
+
----
$ oc secrets new registry-config config.yml=</path/to/custom/registry/config.yml>
----
+
. Redeploy the registry to read the updated configuration:
+
----
$ oc deploy docker-registry --latest
----

[TIP]
====
Maintain configuration files in a source control repository.

        blobrepositorycachettl: 10m <6>
  storage:
    - name: openshift <1>
----
<1> These entries are mandatory. Their presence ensures required components get loaded. These values shouldn't be changed.
<2> Allow to store
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-2[manifest
schema v2] during a push to the registry. See xref:middleware-repository-acceptschema2[below] for more details.
<3> Let the registry act as a proxy for remote blobs. See xref:middleware-repository-pullthrough[below] for more details.
<4> Prevent blob uploads exceeding size limit defined in targeted project.
<5> An expiration timeout for limits cached in the registry. The lower the
value, the less time will it take for the limit changes to propagate to the
registry. However, the registry will query limits from the server more
frequently and, as a consequence, pushes will be slower.
<6> An expiration timeout for remembered associations between blob and
repository. The higher the value, the higher probability of fast lookup and
more efficient registry operation. On the other hand, memory usage will raise
as well as a risk of serving image layer to user, who is no longer authorized
to access it.
====

The link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/#cloudfront[*CloudFront*
middleware extension] can be added to support AWS, CloudFront CDN storage
provider. CloudFront middleware speeds up distribution of image content
internationally. The blobs are distributed to several edge locations around the
world. The client is always directed to the edge with the lowest latency.

The *middleware* section may not be overridden using environment variables.
There are a few exceptions, however. For example:
====
[source,yaml]
----
middleware:
  repository:
    - name: openshift
      options:
        acceptschema2: false <1>
        enforcequota: false <2>
        projectcachettl: 1m <3>
        blobrepositorycachettl: 10m <4>
----
<1> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ACCEPTSCHEMA2*`, which
allows for the ability to accept manifest schema v2 on manifest put requests.
<2> A configuration option that can be overridden by the boolean environment
variable `*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_ENFORCEQUOTA*`, which
allows the ability to turn quota enforcement on or off. By default, quota
enforcement is off. It overrides {product-title} middleware configuration
option. Recognized values are *true* and *false*.
<3> A configuration option that can be overridden by the environment variable
`*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_PROJECTCACHETTL*`, specifying an
eviction timeout for project quota objects. It takes a valid time duration
string (for example, *2m*). If empty, you get the default timeout. If zero
(*0m*), caching is disabled.
<4> A configuration option that can be overriden by the environment variable
`*REGISTRY_MIDDLEWARE_REPOSITORY_OPENSHIFT_BLOBREPOSITORYCACHETTL*`, specifying
an eviction timeout for associations between blob and containing repository.
The format of the value is the same as in `projectcachettl` case.
====

[[middleware-repository-pullthrough]]
==== Image Pullthrough

If enabled, the registry will attempt to fetch requested blob from a remote
registry unless the blob exists locally. The remote candidates are calculated
from **DockerImage** entries stored in status of the
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#image-streams[image
stream], a client pulls from. All the unique remote registry references in
such entries will be tried in turn until the blob is found. The blob, served
this way, will not be stored in the registry.

This feature is on by default. However, it can be disabled using a
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[configuration option].

[[middleware-repository-acceptschema2]]
==== Manifest Schema v2 Support

Each image has a manifest describing its blobs, instructions for running it
and additional metadata. The manifest is versioned which have different
structure and fields as it evolves over time. The same image can be represented
by multiple manifest versions. Each version will have different digest though.

The registry currently supports
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-1[manifest
v2 schema 1] (*schema1*) and
link:https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#image-manifest-version-2-schema-2[manifest
v2 schema 2] (*schema2*). The former is being obsoleted but will be supported
for an extended amount of time.

You should be wary of compatibility issues with various Docker clients:

- Docker clients of version 1.9 or older support only *schema1*. Any manifest
this client pulls or pushes will be of this legacy schema.
- Docker clients of version 1.10 support both *schema1* and *schema2*. And by default, it will
push the latter to the registry if it supports newer schema.

The registry, storing an image with *schema1* will always return it unchanged
to the client. *Schema2* will be transferred unchanged only to newer Docker
client. For the older one, it will be converted on-the-fly to *schema1*.

This has significant consequences. For example an image pushed to the registry
by a newer Docker client cannot be pulled by the older Docker by its digest.
That's because the stored image's manifest is of *schema2* and its digest can
be used to pull only this version of manifest.

For this reason, the registry is configured by default not to store *schema2*.
This ensures that any docker client will be able to pull from the registry any
image pushed there regardless of client's version.

Once you're confident that all the registry clients support *schema2*, you'll
be safe to enable its support in the registry. See the
xref:docker-registry-configuration-reference-middleware[middleware
configuration reference] above for particular option.
