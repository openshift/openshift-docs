Cluster administrators can uninstall the {pipelines-title} Operator by performing the following steps:

. Delete the Custom Resources (CRs) for the optional components, `TektonHub` and `TektonResult`, if these CRs exist, and then delete the `TektonConfig` CR.
+
[CAUTION]
====
If you uninstall the Operator without removing the CRs of optional components, you cannot remove the components later.
====
. Uninstall the {pipelines-title} Operator.
. Delete the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) of the `operator.tekton.dev` group.

Uninstalling only the Operator will not remove the {pipelines-title} components created by default when the Operator is installed.
