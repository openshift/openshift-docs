== Overview

// tag::installconfig_build_defaults_overrides[]
Developers can define settings in specific build configurations within their
projects, such as
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning[configuring a proxy
for Git cloning]. Rather than requiring developers to define certain settings in
each build configuration, administrators can use admission
control plug-ins to configure global build defaults and overrides that
automatically use these settings in any build.

The settings from these plug-ins are used only during the build process
but are not set in the build configurations or
builds themselves. Configuring the settings through the plug-ins
allows administrators to change the global configuration at any time, and any
builds that are re-run from existing build configurations or builds are assigned the
new settings.

* The `BuildDefaults` admission control plug-in allows administrators to set
global defaults for settings such as the Git HTTP and HTTPS proxy, as well as
default environment variables. These defaults do not overwrite values that have
been configured for a specific build. However, if those values are not present
on the build definition, they are set to the default value.

* The `BuildOverrides` admission control plug-in allows administrators to
override a setting in a build, regardless of the value stored in the build.
+
The plug-in currently supports xref:manually-setting-global-build-overrides[overriding the `forcePull` flag on a build strategy]
to force refreshing the local image from the registry during a build. This means
that an access check is performed on an image every time a build starts,
ensuring that users can build only with images they are allowed to pull. A
forced refresh provides multitenancy for your build. However, you can no longer
rely on the local cache of the image stored on the build node; you must always
have access to the registry.
+
The plug-in can also be configured to apply a set of image labels to every built image.
+
For information on configuring the `BuildOverrides` admission control plug-in and
the values you can override, see
xref:manually-setting-global-build-overrides[Manually Setting Global Build Overrides].

The default node selectors and the `BuildDefaults` or `BuildOverride` admission plug-ins work together as follows:

* The default project node selector, defined in the `projectConfig.defaultNodeSelector` field in the master configuration file,  
is applied to the pods created in all projects without a specified `nodeSelector` value. These settings are applied to builds with `nodeSelector="null"` 
on clusters where the `BuildDefaults` or `BuildOverride` nodeselector is not set. 

* The cluster-wide default build node selector, `admissionConfig.pluginConfig.BuildDefaults.configuration.nodeSelector`, 
is applied only if the `nodeSelector="null"` parameter is set in the build configuration. `nodeSelector=null` is the default setting.

* With a default project or cluster-wide node selector, the default setting is added as an AND to the build node selector, 
which is set by the `BuildDefaults` or `BuildOverride` admission plug-ins. These settings mean that the build will be scheduled only 
to nodes that satisfy the `BuildOverrides` node selector AND the project default node selector.

[NOTE]
====
You can define a hard limit on how long build pods can run by using the
xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#manage-pods-limit-run-once-duration[*RunOnceDuration* plugin].

== Setting Global Build Defaults

You can set global build defaults two ways:

- xref:ansible-setting-global-build-defaults[using Ansible]
- xref:manually-setting-global-build-defaults[manually by modifying the *_master-config.yaml_* file]

<1> Force all builds to pull their builder image and any source images before
starting the build.
<2> Additional labels to be applied to every image built. Labels
defined here take precedence over labels defined in `BuildConfig`.
<3> Build pods will only run on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.
    Users can define additional key/value labels to further constrain the set of nodes
    a build runs on, but the *node* must have at least these labels.
<4> Build pods will have these annotations added to them.
<5> Build pods will have any existing tolerations overridden by those listed here.
