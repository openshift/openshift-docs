== Overview

// tag::installconfig_build_defaults_overrides[]
Developers can define settings in specific build configurations within their
projects, such as
xref:../dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.adoc#using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning[configuring a proxy
for Git cloning]. Rather than requiring developers to define certain settings in
each of their build configurations, cluster administrators can use admission
control plug-ins to configure global build defaults and overrides that
automatically use these settings in any build.

The settings from these plug-ins are not set in the build configurations or
builds themselves, but rather are only used during the build process. This
allows administrators to change the global configuration at any time, and any
builds that are re-run from existing build configurations or builds will get the
new settings.

* The `BuildDefaults` admission control plug-in allows administrators to set
global defaults for settings such as the Git HTTP and HTTPS proxy, as well as
default environment variables and image labels. These defaults do not overwrite
values that have been configured for a specific build. However, if those values
are not present on the build definition, they are set to the default value.

* The `BuildOverrides` admission control plug-in allows administrators to
override a setting in a build, regardless of the value stored in the build. It
currently supports overriding the `forcePull` flag on a build strategy to
enforce always refreshing the local image during a build by pulling the image
from the registry. This ensures that a user can only build with an image that
they are allowed to pull. The plug-in can also be configured to apply a set of
image labels to every built image.

You can define a hard limit on how long build pods can run by using the
xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#manage-pods-limit-run-once-duration[*RunOnceDuration* plugin].

You can set global build defaults two ways:

- xref:ansible-setting-global-build-defaults[using Ansible and the advanced installation tool]
- xref:manually-setting-global-build-defaults[manually by modifying the *_master-config.yaml_* file]

=== Manually Setting Global Build Defaults

To configure the `BuildDefaults` plug-in:

. Add a configuration for it in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
 file on the master nodes:

====
[source,yaml]

<1> Sets the HTTP proxy to use when cloning source code from a Git repository.
<2> Sets the HTTPS proxy to use when cloning source code from a Git repository.
<3> Sets the list of domains for which proxying should not be performed.
<4> Default environment variable that sets the HTTP proxy to use during the build.
This can be used for downloading dependencies during the assemble and build
phases.
<5> Default environment variable that sets the HTTPS proxy to use during the
build. This can be used for downloading dependencies during the assemble and
build phases.
<6> Default environment variable that sets the build log level during the build.
<7> Additional default environment variable that will be added to
every build.
<8> Labels to be applied to every image built. These can be overridden in `BuildConfig`.
<9> Build pods will only run on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.
    Users can define a different set of `nodeSelectors` for their builds, causing these
    values to be ignored.
<10> Build pods will have these annotations added to them.
<11> Sets the default resources to the build pod if the `BuildConfig` does not have related resource defined.

defined here take precedence over labels defined in `BuildConfig`.
<3> Build pods will only run on nodes with the `key1=value2` and `key2=value2` labels.
    Users can define additional key/value labels to further constrain the set of nodes
    a build runs on, but the *node* must have at least these labels.
<4> Build pods will have these annotations added to them.
<5> Build pods will have any existing tolerations overridden by those listed here.
