== Overview
Administrators can customize the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console]
using extensions, which let you run scripts and load custom stylesheets when the
web console loads. You can change the look and feel of nearly any aspect of the
user interface in this way.

== Loading Custom Scripts and Stylesheets
To add scripts and stylesheets, edit the
link:../install_config/master_node_configuration.html[master configuration
file]. The scripts and stylesheet files must exist on the Asset Server and are
added with the following options:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionScripts:
    - /path/to/script1.js
    - /path/to/script2.js
    - ...
  extensionStylesheets:
    - /path/to/stylesheet1.css
    - /path/to/stylesheet2.css
    - ...
----
====

Relative paths are resolved relative to the master configuration file. To pick
up configuration changes, restart the server.

Custom scripts and stylesheets are read once at server start time. To make
developing extensions easier, you can reload scripts and stylesheets on every
request by enabling development mode with the following setting:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionDevelopment: true
----
====

When set, the web console reloads any changes to existing extension script or
stylesheet files when you refresh the page in your browser. You still must
restart the server when adding new extension stylesheets or scripts, however.
This setting is only recommended for testing changes and not for production.

The following examples show common ways you can customize the web console.

*Customizing the Logo*

The following style changes the logo in the web console header:

====
----
#header-logo {
  background-image: url("https://www.example.com/images/logo.png");
  width: 190px;
  height: 20px;
}
----
====

Replace the *example.com* URL with a URL to an actual image, and adjust the
width and height. The ideal height is *20px*.

Save the style to a file, for example *_logo.css_*, and add it to the master
configuration file:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionStylesheets:
    - /path/to/logo.css
----
====

*Changing links to documentation*

Links to external documentation are shown in various sections of the web 
console. The following example changes the URL for two given links to docs:

====
----
window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.HELP['get_started_cli']      = "https://example.com/doc1.html";
window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.HELP['basic_cli_operations'] = "https://example.com/doc2.html";
----
====

Save this script to a file, for example *_help-links.js_*, and add it to the
master configuration file:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionScripts:
    - /path/to/help-links.js
----
====

*Adding or changing links to download the CLI*

The "About" page in the web console provides links to where users can download
the link:../cli_reference/index.html[command line interface (CLI)] tools. These
links can be configured by providing both the link text and URL, so that you can
choose to point them directly to file packages, or to an external page that
points to the actual packages.

For example, to point directly to packages that can be downloaded, where the link
text is the package platform:

====
----
window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.CLI = {
  "Linux (32 bits)": "https://<cdn>/openshift-client-tools-linux-32bit.tar.gz",
  "Linux (64 bits)": "https://<cdn>/openshift-client-tools-linux-64bit.tar.gz",
  "Windows":         "https://<cdn>/openshift-client-tools-windows.zip",
  "Mac OS X":        "https://<cdn>/openshift-client-tools-mac.zip"
};
----
====

Or, to point to a page that links the actual download packages, with the "Latest
Release" link text:

====
----
window.OPENSHIFT_CONSTANTS.CLI = {
  "Latest Release": "https://<cdn>/openshift-client-tools/latest.html"
};
----
====

Save this script to a file, for example *_cli-links.js_*, and add it to the
master configuration file:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensionScripts:
    - /path/to/cli-links.js
----
====

[NOTE]
====
More extension examples are available in the link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/assets/extensions/examples[OpenShift Origin] repository on Github.
====

== Serving Static Files

You can serve other files from the Asset Server as well. For example, you might
want to make the CLI executable available for download from the web console or
add images to use in a custom stylesheet.

Add the directory with the files you want using the following configuration
option:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensions:
    - name: images
      sourceDirectory: /path/to/my_images
----
====

The files under the *_/path/to/my_images_* directory will be available under the
URL _/<context>/extensions/images_ in the web console.

To reference these files from a stylesheet, you should generally use a relative
path. For example:

====
----
#header-logo {
  background-image: url("../extensions/images/my-logo.png");
}
----
====

=== Enabling HTML5 Mode

The web console has a special mode for supporting certain static web
applications that use the HTML5 history API:

====
----
assetConfig:
  ...
  extensions:
    - name: my_extension
      sourceDirectory: /path/to/myExtension
      html5Mode: true
----
====

Setting `*html5Mode*` to *true* enables two behaviors:

. Any request for a non-existent file under
*_/<context>/extensions/my_extension/_* instead serves
*_/path/to/myExtension/index.html_* rather than a "404 Not Found" page.
. The element `<base href="/">` will be rewritten in
*_/path/to/myExtension/index.html_* to use the actual base depending on the
asset configuration; only this exact string is rewritten.

This is needed for JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS that require `*base*`
to be set in *_index.html_*.

== Customizing the Login Page

You can also change the login page, and the login provider selection page for the web console. Run the following
commands to create templates you can modify:

====
----
$ oadm create-login-template > login-template.html
$ oadm create-provider-selection-template > provider-selection-template.html
----
====

Edit the file to change the styles or add content, but be careful not to remove
any required parameters inside curly braces.

To use your custom login page or provider selection page, set the following options in the master
configuration file:

====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  templates:
    login: /path/to/login-template.html
    providerSelection: /path/to/provider-selection-template.html
----
====

Relative paths are resolved relative to the master configuration file. You must
restart the server after changing this configuration.

== Customizing the OAuth Error Page

You can also change the page shown when errors occur during authentication.
Run the following command to create a template you can modify:

====
----
$ oadm create-error-template > error-template.html
----
====

Edit the file to change the styles or add content.
You can use the Error and ErrorCode variables in the template.

To use your custom error page, set the following option in the master configuration file:

====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  templates:
    error: /path/to/error-template.html
----
====

Relative paths are resolved relative to the master configuration file. You must
restart the server after changing this configuration.

== Changing the Logout URL

You can change the location a console user is sent to when logging out of
the console by modifying the `*logoutURL*` parameter in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file:

====
----
...
assetConfig:
  logoutURL: "http://www.example.com"
...
----
====

This can be useful when authenticating with
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#RequestHeaderIdentityProvider[Request
Header] and OAuth or
link:../install_config/configuring_authentication.html#OpenID[OpenID] identity
providers, which require visiting an external URL to destroy single sign-on
sessions.
