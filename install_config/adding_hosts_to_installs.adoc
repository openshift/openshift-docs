== Overview

Depending on how your {product-title} cluster was installed, you can add new
hosts (either nodes or masters) to your installation by using the install tool
for quick installations, or by using the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook for advanced
installations.

[[adding-nodes-or-reinstalling-quick]]
== Adding Hosts Using the Quick Installer Tool

If you used the quick install tool to install your {product-title} cluster, you
can use the quick install tool to add a new node host to your existing cluster,
or to reinstall the cluster entirely.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you can not add new master hosts if you used the quick install. 
====

If you used the installer in either
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#running-an-interactive-installation[interactive] or
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#running-an-unattended-installation[unattended] mode, you can re-run the
installation as long as you have an
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[installation configuration
file] at *_~/.config/openshift/installer.cfg.yml_* (or specify a different
location with the `-c` option).

////
If you installed using the
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#install-config-install-advanced-install[advanced
installation] method and therefore do not have an installation configuration
file, you can either try
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#defining-an-installation-configuration-file[creating your own] based on
your cluster's current configuration, or see the advanced installation method on
how to
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#adding-nodes-advanced[run
the playbook for adding new nodes directly].
////

[IMPORTANT]
====
The recommended maximum number of nodes is 300.
====

To add nodes to your installation:

. Re-run the installer with the `install` subcommand in interactive or
unattended mode:
+
----
$ atomic-openshift-installer [-u] [-c </path/to/file>] install
----

. The installer detects your current environment and allows you to either
add an additional node or re-perform a clean install:
+
====
----
Gathering information from hosts...
Installed environment detected.
By default the installer only adds new nodes to an installed environment.
Do you want to (1) only add additional nodes or (2) perform a clean install?:
----
====
+
Choose (1) and follow the on-screen instructions to complete your desired task.

[[adding-nodes-advanced]]
== Adding Hosts Using the Advanced Install

If you installed using the advanced install, you can add new hosts to your
cluster by running the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook. This playbook queries the
master, generates and distributes new certificates for the new hosts, then runs
the configuration playbooks on the new hosts only.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
This process is similar to re-running the installer in the
xref:../install_config/install/quick_install.adoc#adding-nodes-or-reinstalling-quick[quick
installation method to add nodes], however you have more configuration options
available when using the advanced method and when running the playbooks
directly.
endif::[]

You must have an existing inventory file (for example, *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*)
that is representative of your current cluster configuration in order to run the
*_scaleup.yml_* playbook.
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
If you previously used the `atomic-openshift-installer` command to run your
installation, you can check *_~/.config/openshift/.ansible/hosts_* for the last
inventory file that the installer generated, and use or modify that as needed as
your inventory file. You must then specify the file location with `-i` when
calling `ansible-playbook` later.
endif::[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The recommended maximum number of nodes is 300.
====

To add a host to an existing cluster:

. Ensure you have the latest playbooks by updating the *atomic-openshift-utils*
package:
+
----
# yum update atomic-openshift-utils
----

. Edit your *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file and add `new_<host_type>` to the
*[OSEv3:children]* section:
+
For example, to add a new node host, add `new_nodes`:
+
====
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
new_nodes
----
====
+
To add a new master hosts, add `new_master`.

. Create a *[new_<host_type>]* section much like an existing section,
specifying host information for any new hosts you want to add. For example,
when adding a new node:
+
====
----
[nodes]
master[1:3].example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"

[new_nodes]
node3.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
----
====
+
See
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-host-variables[Configuring
Host Variables] for more options.

. Run the *_scaleup.yml_* playbook. If your inventory file is located somewhere
other than the default of *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*, specify the location with the
`-i option`.
+
For additional nodes:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
----
+
For additional masters:
+
----
# ansible-playbook [-i /path/to/file] \
    usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-master/scaleup.yml
----

. After the playbook completes successfully,
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#advanced-verifying-the-installation[verify the installation].

. Finally, move any hosts you had defined in the *[new_<host_type>]* section
into their appropriate section (but leave the *[new_<host_type>]* section
definition itself in place) so that subsequent runs using this inventory file
are aware of the nodes but do not handle them as new nodes. For example, when
adding new nodes:
+
====
----
[nodes]
master[1:3].example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
node3.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
