== Overview
When deployed on link:https://www.openstack.org/[OpenStack], {product-title} can
be configured to access the OpenStack infrastructure, including
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/persistent_storage_cinder.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-persistent-storage-cinder[using OpenStack Cinder volumes as persistent storage] for application data.

[[provisioning-openstack-instances]]
== Provisioning {product-title} Instances using the OpenShift Ansible Playbooks

Once the creation and configuration of the deployment host is complete, we turn
to preparing the environment for the deployment of {product-title} using Ansible. In
the following subsections, Ansible is configured and certain YAML files are modified
to achieve a successful {product-title} on OpenStack deployment.

include::install_config/topics/ocp_osp_provisioning.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[[registering-openstack-nodes]]
== Registering with Subscription Manager the {product-title} Instances

With the nodes successfully provisioned, the next step is to ensure all the
nodes are successfully registered via `subscription-manager` to install all the
required packages for a successful {product-title} installation. For simplicity,
a *_repos.yml_* file has been created and provided.

[[installation-openstack-playbook]]
== Installing {product-title} by Using an Ansible Playbook

With the OpenStack instances provisioned, the focus shifts to the installation
{product-title}. The installation and configuration is done via a series of Ansible
playbooks and roles provided by the OpenShift RPM packages. Review the
OSEv3.yml file that was previous configured to ensure all the options have been properly set.

== Applying Configuration Changes to Existing {product-title} Environment

[[configuring-openstack-variables]]
=== Configuring OpenStack Variables on an existing OpenShift Environment

To set the required OpenStack variables, modify the *_/etc/origin/cloudprovider/openstack.conf_* file with
the following contents on all of your {product-title} hosts, both masters and
nodes:

----
[Global]
auth-url = <OS_AUTH_URL>
username = <OS_USERNAME>
password = <password>
domain-id = <OS_USER_DOMAIN_ID>
tenant-id = <OS_TENANT_ID>
region = <OS_REGION_NAME>

[LoadBalancer]
subnet-id = <UUID of the load balancer subnet>
----

Consult your OpenStack administrators for values of the `*OS_*` variables, which
are commonly used in OpenStack configuration.

[[openstack-configuring-zone-labels]]
=== Configuring Zone Labels for Dynamically Created OpenStack PVs

Administrators can configure zone labels for dynamically
created OpenStack PVs. This option is useful if the OpenStack Cinder zone name
does not match the compute zone names, for example, if there is only one Cinder
zone and many compute zones. Administrators can create Cinder volumes
dynamically and then check the labels.

To view the zone labels for the PVs:

----
# oc get pv --show-labels
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS    CLAIM                 STORAGECLASS   REASON    AGE       LABELS
pvc-1faa6f93-64ac-11e8-930c-fa163e3c373c   1Gi        RWO            Delete           Bound     openshift-node/pvc1   standard                 12s       failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=nova
----

The default setting is enabled. Using the `oc get pv --show-labels` command returns the `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=nova` label.

To disable the zone label, update the *_openstack.conf_* file by adding:

----
[BlockStorage]
ignore-volume-az = yes
----

The PVs created after restarting the master services will not have the zone label.
