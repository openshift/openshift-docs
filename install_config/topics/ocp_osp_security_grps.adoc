==== Creating OpenStack Deployment Host Security Group

OpenStack networking allows the user to define inbound and outbound traffic filters
that can be applied to each instance on a network. This allows the user to limit
network traffic to each instance based on the function of the instance services
and not depend on host based filtering. The OpenShift Ansible installer handles
the proper creation of all the ports and services required for each type of host
that is part of the {product-title} cluster except for the deployment host. 

The following command creates an empty security group with no rules set for the
deployment host. 

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source path/to/examplerc
$ openstack security group create *<deployment-sg-name>*
----

Verify the creation of the security group via:

----
$ openstack security group list

===== Deployment Host Security Group

The deployment instance only needs to allow inbound `ssh`. This instance exists 
to give operators a stable base to deploy, monitor and manage the {product-title} 
environment.

.Deployment Host Security Group TCP ports
|===
|Port/Protocol |Service |Remote source |Purpose

|ICMP | ICMP |Any | Allow ping, traceroute, etc.
|22/TCP |SSH |Any |Secure shell login
|===

Creation of the above security group rules is as follows:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack security group rule create \
    --ingress \
    --protocol icmp \
    *<deployment-sg-name>*
$ openstack security group rule create \
    --ingress \
    --protocol tcp \
    --dst-port 22 \
    *<deployment-sg-name>*
----

Verification of the security group rules is as follows:

[subs=+quotes]

$ openstack security group rule list *<deployment-sg-name>*
