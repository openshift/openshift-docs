= Option 2: Manually configuring {product-title} for vSphere

== Manually configuring master hosts for vSphere

Perform the following on all master hosts.

.Procedure

. Edit the master configuration file at `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml`
by default on all masters and update the contents of the `apiServerArguments`
and `controllerArguments` sections:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kubernetesMasterConfig:
  ...
  apiServerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "vsphere"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/origin/cloudprovider/vsphere.conf"*
  controllerArguments:
    cloud-provider:
      - "vsphere"
    cloud-config:
      - "/etc/origin/cloudprovider/vsphere.conf"*
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When triggering a containerized installation, only the *_/etc/origin_* and
*_/var/lib/origin_* directories are mounted to the master and node container.
Therefore, *_master-config.yaml_* must be in *_/etc/origin/master_* rather than
*_/etc/_*.
====

. When you configure {product-title} for vSphere using Ansible, the
*_/etc/origin/cloudprovider/vsphere.conf_* file is created automatically.
Because you are manually configuring {product-title} for vSphere, you must
create the file and enter the following:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
[Global] <1>
        user = "myusername" <2>
        password = "mypassword" <3>
        port = "443" <4>
        insecure-flag = "1" <5>
        datacenter = "mydatacenter" <6>

[VirtualCenter "10.10.0.2"] <7>
        user = "myvCenterusername"
        password = "password"

[VirtualCenter "10.10.0.3"] <8>
        port = "448"
        insecure-flag = "0"

[Workspace] <9>
        server = "10.10.0.2" <10>
        datacenter = "mydatacenter"
        folder = "path/to/vms" <11>
        datastore = "shared-datastore" <12>
        resourcepool-path = "myresourcepoolpath" <13>

[Disk]
        scsicontrollertype = pvscsi <14>

[Network]
        public-network = "VM Network" <15>
----
<1> Any properties set in the `[Global]` section are used for all specified vcenters unless overriden by the settings in the individual `[VirtualCenter]` sections.
<2> vCenter username for the vSphere cloud provider.
<3> vCenter password for the specified user.
<4> Optional. Port number for the vCenter server. Defaults to port `443`.
<5>  Set to `1` if the vCenter uses a self-signed cert.
<6> Name of the data center on which Node VMs are deployed.
<7> Override specific `[Global]` properties for this Virtual Center. Possible setting scan be `[Port]`, `[user]`, `[insecure-flag]`, `[datacenters]`. Any settings not specified are pulled from the `[Global]` section.
<8> Optional. Additional vCenter server.
<9> Set any properties used for various vSphere Cloud Provider functionality. For example, dynamic provisioning, Storage Profile Based Volume provisioning, and others.
<10> IP Address or FQDN for the vCenter server.
<11> Path to the VM directory for node VMs.
<12> Set to the name of the datastore to use for provisioning volumes using the storage classes or dynamic provisioning. Prior to 3.9, if the datastore is located in a storage directory or is a member of a datastore cluster, the full path was required.
<13> Optional. Set to the path to the resource pool where dummy VMs for Storage Profile Based volume provisioning should be created.
<14> Type of SCSI controller the VMDK will be attached to the VM as.
<15> Set to the network port group for vSphere to access the node, which is called VM Network by default. This is the node host's ExternalIP that is registered with Kubernetes.

The cluster installation process configures single-zone or single vCenter by default.

Deploying {product-title} in vSphere on different zones can be helpful to avoid
single-point-of-failures, but creates the need for shared storage across zones.
If an {product-title} node host goes down in zone "A" and the pods
should be moved to zone "B".
See https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/multiple-zones/#limitations[Multiple zone
limitations] in the Kubernetes documentation for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This ensures that the VMDK always presents a consistent UUID to the VM, allowing the disk
to be mounted properly.

====
+
For every virtual machine node that will be participating in the cluster:
VM properties -> VM Options -> Advanced -> Configuration Parameters -> disk.enabledUUID=TRUE
+
Alternatively, link:https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc[GOVC tool] can be used:
+
.. Set up the GOVC environment:
+
[source,bash]
----
export GOVC_URL='vCenter IP OR FQDN'
export GOVC_USERNAME='vCenter User'
export GOVC_PASSWORD='vCenter Password'
export GOVC_INSECURE=1
----
+
. Find the Node VM paths:
+
[source,bash]
----
govc ls /datacenter/vm/<vm-folder-name>
----
.. Set disk.EnableUUID to true for all VMs:
+
[source,bash]
----
govc vm.change -e="disk.enableUUID=1" -vm='VM Path'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If {product-title} node VMs are created from a template VM, then
`disk.EnableUUID=1` can be set on the template VM. VMs cloned from this
template, inherit this property.
====
+
. Restart the {product-title} host services:
+
[source,bash]
----
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

== Manually configuring node hosts for vSphere

Perform the following on all node hosts.

.Procedure

To configure the {product-title} nodes for vSphere:

. Edit the appropriate xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#modifying-nodes[node
configuration map] and update the contents of the `*kubeletArguments*`
section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  cloud-provider:
    - "vsphere"
  cloud-config:
    - "/etc/origin/cloudprovider/vsphere.conf"*
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `nodeName` must match the VM name in vSphere in order
for the cloud provider integration to work properly. The name must also be
RFC1123 compliant.
====

. Restart the {product-title} services on all nodes.
+
[source,bash]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
