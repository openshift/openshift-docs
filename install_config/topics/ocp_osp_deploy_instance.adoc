==== Creating and Configuring the Deployment Instance

The role of the deployment instance is to serve
as a utility host for the deployment and management of {product-title}.

*Creating the Deployment Host Network and Router*

Prior to instance creation, an internal network and router
must be created for communication with the deployment host. The
following commands create that network and router.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source path/to/examplerc

$ openstack network create *<deployment-net-name>*

$ openstack subnet create --network *<deployment-net-name>* \
  --subnet-range *<subnet_range>* \
  --dns-nameserver *<dns-ip>* \
  *<deployment-subnet-name>*

$ openstack router create *<deployment-router-name>*

$ openstack router set --external-gateway *<public-net-name>* *<deployment-router-name>*

$ openstack router add subnet *<deployment-router-name>* *<deployment-subnet-name>*
----

*Deploying the Deployment Instance*

With the network and security group created, deploy the instance.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ domain=*<domain>*
$ netid1=$(openstack network show *<deployment-net-name>* -f value -c id)
$ openstack server create \
    --nic net-id=$netid1 \
    --flavor *<flavor>* \
    --image *<image>* \
    --key-name *<keypair>* \
    --security-group *<deployment-sg-name>* \
    deployment.$domain
----

NOTE: If the `m1.small` flavor does not exist by default then use an existing
flavor that meets the requirements of 1 vCPU and 2GB of RAM.

*Creating and Adding Floating IP to the Deployment Instance*

Once the deployment instance is created, a floating IP must be created and then
allocated to the instance. The following shows an example.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack floating ip create *<public-network-name>*
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Field               | Value                                |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+

| floating_ip_address | 10.20.120.150                       |
| floating_network_id | 084884f9-d9d2-477a-bae7-26dbb4ff1873 |

+---------------------+--------------------------------------+

Within the above output, the `floating_ip_address` field shows that the floating
IP `10.20.120.150` is created. In order to assign this IP to the deployment instance,
 run the following command:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack server add floating ip *<deployment-instance-name> <ip>*
----

For example, if instance `deployment.example.com` is to be assigned IP
`10.20.120.150` the command would be:

----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack server add floating ip deployment.example.com 10.20.120.150
----

*Adding the RC File to the Deployment Host*

Once the deployment host exists, copy the RC file created earlier to the
deployment host via `scp` as follows

----
scp <rc-file-deployment-host> cloud-user@<ip>:/home/cloud-user/
----

==== Deployment Host Configuration for {product-title}

The following subsections describe all the steps needed to properly configure
the deployment instance.

[[ssh_forwarding]]
*Configure ~/.ssh/config to use Deployment Host as a Jumphost*

To easily connect to the {product-title} environment, follow the steps below.

On the OpenStack director node or local workstation with the private key,
<keypair-name>.pem:

----
$ exec ssh-agent bash

$ ssh-add /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem
Identity added: /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem (/path/to/<keypair-name>.pem)
----

Add to the `~/.ssh/config` file:

----
Host deployment
    HostName        <deployment_fqdn_hostname OR IP address>
    User            cloud-user
    IdentityFile    /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem
    ForwardAgent     yes
----

`ssh` into the deployment host with the `-A` option that enables forwarding of
the authentication agent connection.

Ensure the permissions are read write only for the owner of the _~/.ssh/config_
file:

----
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
----

----
$ ssh -A cloud-user@deployment
----

Once logged into the deployment host, verify the ssh agent forwarding is working
via checking for the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`

----
$ echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
/tmp/ssh-NDFDQD02qB/agent.1387
----

*Subscription Manager and Enabling {product-title} Repositories*

Within the deployment instance, register it with the Red Hat Subscription
Manager. This can be accomplished by using credentials:

----
$ sudo subscription-manager register --username <user> --password '<password>'
----

Alternatively, you can use an activation key:

----
$ sudo subscription-manager register --org="<org_id>" --activationkey=<keyname>
----


Once registered, enable the following repositories as follows.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.11-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.5-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-openstack-13-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-openstack-13-tools-rpms"
----

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the
xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#set-up-repositories[Set Up Repositories]
to confirm the proper {product-title} repositories and Ansible versions
to enable. The above file is just a sample.
====

*Required Packages on the Deployment Host*

The following packages are required to be installed on the deployment host.

Install the following packages:

* `openshift-ansible`
* `python-openstackclient`
* `python2-heatclient`
* `python2-octaviaclient`
* `python2-shade`
* `python-dns`
* `git`
* `ansible`

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo yum -y install openshift-ansible python-openstackclient python2-heatclient python2-octaviaclient python2-shade python-dns git ansible
----

*Configure Ansible*

`ansible` is installed on the deployment instance to perform the registration,
installation of packages, and the deployment of the {product-title} environment on the
master and node instances.

Before running playbooks, it is important to create an *_ansible.cfg_* file to reflect
the environment you wish to deploy:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cat ~/ansible.cfg*

[defaults]
forks = 20
host_key_checking = False
remote_user = openshift
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = $HOME/ansible/facts
fact_caching_timeout = 600
log_path = $HOME/ansible.log
nocows = 1
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
inventory = /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/inventory.py,/home/cloud-user/inventory

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600s -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false
control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
pipelining = True
timeout = 10

[persistent_connection]
connect_timeout = 30
connect_retries = 30
connect_interval = 1
----

[WARNING]
====

The following parameters values are important to the *_ansible.cfg_* file.

* The `remote_user` must remain as the user _openshift_.
* The inventory parameter ensure that there is no space between the two
inventories.

Example: _inventory = path/to/inventory1,path/to/inventory2_
====

The code block above can overwrite the default values in the file.
Ensure to populate <keypair-name> with the keypair that was copied to the
deployment instance.

[NOTE]
====
The _inventory_ folder is created in <<inventory_provision>>.
====

*OpenShift Authentication*

{product-title} provides the ability to use many different authentication platforms.
A listing of authentication options are available at
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configuring Authentication and User Agent].

Configuring the default identity provider is important as the default configuration
is to Deny All.
