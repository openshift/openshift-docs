==== Creating and Configuring the Deployment Instance

The role of the deployment instance is to serve
as a utility host for the deployment and management of {product-title}.

===== Creating the Deployment Host Network and Router

Prior to instance creation, an internal network and router
must be created for communication with the deployment host. The 
following commands create that network and router.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source path/to/examplerc

$ openstack network create *<deployment-net-name>*

$ openstack subnet create --network *<deployment-net-name>* \
  --subnet-range *<subnet_range>* \
  --dns-nameserver *<dns-ip>* \
  *<deployment-subnet-name>*

$ openstack router create *<deployment-router-name>*

$ openstack router set --external-gateway *<public-net-name>* *<deployment-router-name>*

$ openstack router add subnet *<deployment-router-name>* *<deployment-subnet-name>*
----

===== Deploying the Deployment Instance

With the network and security group created, deploy the instance.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ domain=*<domain>*
$ netid1=$(openstack network show *<deployment-net-name>* -f value -c id)
$ openstack server create \
    --nic net-id=$netid1 \
    --flavor *<flavor>* \
    --image *<image>* \
    --key-name *<keypair>* \
    --security-group *<deployment-sg-name>* \
    deployment.$domain
----

NOTE: If the `m1.small` flavor does not exist by default then use an existing
flavor that meets the requirements of 1 vCPU and 2GB of RAM.

===== Creating and Adding Floating IP to the Deployment Instance

Once the deployment instance is created, a floating IP must be created and then
allocated to the instance. The following shows an example

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack floating ip create *<public-network-name>*
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Field               | Value                                |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
| created_at          | 2017-08-24T22:44:03Z                 |
| description         |                                      |
| fixed_ip_address    | None                                 |
| floating_ip_address | 10.20.120.150                       |
| floating_network_id | 084884f9-d9d2-477a-bae7-26dbb4ff1873 |
| headers             |                                      |
| id                  | 2bc06e39-1efb-453e-8642-39f910ac8fd1 |
| port_id             | None                                 |
| project_id          | ca304dfee9a04597b16d253efd0e2332     |
| project_id          | ca304dfee9a04597b16d253efd0e2332     |
| revision_number     | 1                                    |
| router_id           | None                                 |
| status              | DOWN                                 |
| updated_at          | 2017-08-24T22:44:03Z                 |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
----

Within the above output, the `floating_ip_address` field shows that the floating
IP `10.20.120.150` is created. In order to assign this IP to the deployment instance,
 run the following command:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack server add floating ip *<deployment-instance-name> <ip>*
----

For example, if instance `deployment.example.com` is to be assigned IP
`10.20.120.150` the command would be:

----
$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ openstack server add floating ip deployment.example.com 10.20.120.150
----

===== Adding the RC File to the Deployment Host

Once the deployment host exists, copy the RC file created earlier to the
deployment host via `scp` as follows

----
scp <rc-file-deployment-host> cloud-user@<ip>:/home/cloud-user/
----

==== Deployment Host Configuration for {product-title}

The following subsections describe all the steps needed to properly configure
the deployment instance.

[[ssh_forwarding]]
====== Configure ~/.ssh/config to use Deployment Host as a Jumphost

To easily connect to the {product-title} environment, follow the steps below.

On the OpenStack director node or local workstation with the private key,
<keypair-name>.pem:

----
$ exec ssh-agent bash

$ ssh-add /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem 
Identity added: /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem (/path/to/<keypair-name>.pem)
----

Add to the `~/.ssh/config` file:

----
Host deployment
    HostName        <deployment_fqdn_hostname OR IP address>
    User            cloud-user
    IdentityFile    /path/to/<keypair-name>.pem
    ForwardAgent     yes
----

`ssh` into the deployment host with the `-A` option that enables forwarding of
the authentication agent connection.

Ensure the permissions are read write only for the owner of the _~/.ssh/config_
file:

----
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
----

----
$ ssh -A cloud-user@deployment
----

Once logged into the deployment host, verify the ssh agent forwarding is working
via checking for the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`

----
$ echo "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK"
/tmp/ssh-NDFDQD02qB/agent.1387
----

====== Subscription Manager and Enabling {product-title} Repositories

Within the deployment instance, register it with the Red Hat Subscription 
Manager. This can be accomplished by using credentials:

----
$ sudo subscription-manager register --username <user> --password '<password>'
----

Alternatively, you can use an activation key:

----
$ sudo subscription-manager register --org="<org_id>" --activationkey=<keyname>
----


Once registered, enable the following repositories as follows.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.10-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-ansible-2.4-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-openstack-13-rpms" \
    --enable="rhel-7-server-openstack-13-tools-rpms"
----

NOTE: Please refer to the
xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#set-up-repositories[Set Up Repositories]
to confirm the proper {product-title} repositories and Ansible versions 
to enable. The above file is just a sample.


====== Required Packages on the Deployment Host

The following packages are required to be installed on the deployment host.

Install the following packages:

* `openshift-ansible`
* `python-openstackclient`
* `python2-heatclient`
* `python2-octaviaclient`
* `python2-shade`
* `python-dns`
* `git`
* `ansible`

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo yum -y install openshift-ansible python-openstackclient python2-heatclient python2-octaviaclient python2-shade python-dns git ansible
----

====== Configure Ansible

`ansible` is installed on the deployment instance to perform the registration, 
installation of packages, and the deployment of the {product-title} environment on the 
master and node instances.

Before running playbooks, it is important to create an *_ansible.cfg_* file to reflect 
the environment you wish to deploy:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ *cat ~/ansible.cfg*

[defaults]
forks = 20
host_key_checking = False
remote_user = openshift
gathering = smart
fact_caching = jsonfile
fact_caching_connection = $HOME/ansible/facts
fact_caching_timeout = 600
log_path = $HOME/ansible.log
nocows = 1
callback_whitelist = profile_tasks
inventory = /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/openstack/inventory.py,/home/cloud-user/inventory

[ssh_connection]
ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=600s -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false
control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
pipelining = True
timeout = 10

[persistent_connection]
connect_timeout = 30
connect_retries = 30
connect_interval = 1
----

[WARNING]
====

The following parameters values are important to the *_ansible.cfg_* file.

* The `remote_user` must remain as the user _openshift_. 
* The inventory parameter ensure that there is no space between the two
inventories.

Example: _inventory = path/to/inventory1,path/to/inventory2_
====

The code block above can overwrite the default values in the file. 
Ensure to populate <keypair-name> with the keypair that was copied to the 
deployment instance.

NOTE: The _inventory_ folder is created in <<inventory_provision>>. 

====== OpenShift Authentication

{product-title} provides the ability to use many different authentication platforms.
A listing of authentication options are available at
xref:../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configuring Authentication and User Agent].

Configuring the default identity provider is important as the default configuration
is to Deny All.
