Start or restart {product-title} services on all master and node hosts to apply your
configuration changes, see xref:../install_config/master_node_configuration#master-node-config-restart-services[Restarting {product-title} services]:

# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node

[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes architecture expects reliable endpoints from cloud providers. When a
cloud provider is down, the kubelet prevents {product-title} from restarting.
If the underlying cloud provider endpoints are not reliable, do not install a
cluster that uses the cloud provider integration. Install the cluster as if it
is a bare metal environment. It is not recommended to toggle cloud provider
integration on or off in an installed cluster. However, if that scenario is
unavoidable, then complete the following process.
====

Switching from not using a cloud provider to using a cloud provider produces an
error message. Adding the cloud provider tries to delete the node because the
node switches from using the *hostname* as the `*externalID*` (which would have
been the case when no cloud provider was being used) to using the cloud
provider's  `*instance-id*` (which is what the cloud provider specifies). To
resolve this issue:

.  Log in to the CLI as a cluster administrator.
. Check and back up existing node labels:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc describe node <node_name> | grep -Poz '(?s)Labels.*\n.*(?=Taints)'
----
.  Delete the nodes:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc delete node <node_name>
----
.  On each node host, restart the {product-title} service.
+
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
----
# systemctl restart origin-node
----
endif::[]
.  Add back any xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[labels on each node] that you previously had.
