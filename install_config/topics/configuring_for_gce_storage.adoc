= Configuring {product-title} to use GCP storage

{product-title} can use GCP storage using persistent volumes mechanisms.
{product-title} creates the disk in GCP and attaches the disk to the correct
instance.

GCP disks are `ReadWriteOnce` access mode, which means the volume can be mounted
as read-write by a single node. See
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html#pv-access-modes[the Access
modes section of the Architecture guide] for more information.

.Procedure

. {product-title} creates the following `storageclass` when you use the `gce-pd`
provisioner and if you use the `openshift_cloudprovider_kind=gce` and
`openshift_gcp_*` variables in the Ansible inventory. Otherwise, if you
configured {product-title} without using Ansible and the `storageclass` has not
been created at installation time, you can create it manually:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc get --export storageclass standard -o yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
 annotations:
   storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
 creationTimestamp: null
 name: standard
 selfLink: /apis/storage.k8s.io/v1/storageclasses/standard
parameters:
 type: pd-standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
reclaimPolicy: Delete
----
+
After you request a PV and using the storageclass shown in the previous step,
{product-title} creates disks in the GCP infrastructure. To verify that the disks were created:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ gcloud compute disks list | grep kubernetes
kubernetes-dynamic-pvc-10ded514-7625-11e8-8c52-42010af00003  us-west1-b  10       pd-standard  READY
