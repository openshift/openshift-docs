= Configuring Red Hat Virtualization objects

To integrate {product-title} with Red Hat Virtualization, take the following
actions as part of your
xref:../install/host_preparation.adoc#install-config-install-host-preparation[host preparation].

. To provide high availability in case of the loss of one hypervisor host,
add each class of instance to a negative affinity group. See
link:https://ovirt.org/develop/release-management/features/sla/vm-affinity/[VM Affinity].

. To ensure that the {product-title} environment meets the
xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#hardware[minimum hardware requirements],
create templates for virtual machines that use the following resources:
+
[cols="1,7"]
|===

|Master nodes
a|* Minimum 2 CPU Cores
* 16 GB Memory
* Minimum 10 GB root disk
* Minimum 15 GB container image registry disk
* 30 GB local volume disk
* Minimum 25 GB etcd disk

|Infrastructure nodes
a|* Minimum 2 CPU Cores
* 16 GB Memory
* Minimum 10 GB root disk
* Minimum 15 GB container image registry disk
* 30 GB local volume disk
* Minimum 25 GB Gluster registry disk

|Application nodes
a|* 2 CPU Cores
* 8 GB Memory
* Minimum 10 GB root disk
* Minimum 15 GB container image registry disk
* 30 GB local volume disk

|Load balancer node
a|* 1 CPU Core
* 4 GB Memory
* 10 GB root disk

. Create master, infrastructure, and application nodes as well as a load
balancer node. Use the templates that you created.

. Create DNS entries for the routers. Provide entries for all infrastructure
instances and configure a round-robin strategy so that the router can pass
traffic to applications.

. Create a DNS entry for the {product-title} web console. Specify the 
IP address of the load balancer node.

. To use Red Hat Virtualization, you must provide external storage, for example
GlusterFS, for persistent storage of registry images and for application storage.
