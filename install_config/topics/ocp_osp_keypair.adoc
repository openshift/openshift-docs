[[keypair]]
==== Creating an OpenStack Keypair

{rhosp} uses `cloud-init` to place an `ssh` public key on each instance as it is
created to allow `ssh` access to the instance. {rhosp} expects the user to hold
the private key.

WARNING: Losing the private key will cause the inability to access the instances.

To generate a keypair, use the following command:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack keypair create *<keypair-name>* > */path/to/<keypair-name>.pem*
----

Verification of the keypair creation can be done via:

----
$ openstack keypair list
----

Once the keypair is created, set the permissions to `600` thus only allowing the
owner of the file to read and write to that file.

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ chmod 600 */path/to/<keypair-name>.pem*
----
