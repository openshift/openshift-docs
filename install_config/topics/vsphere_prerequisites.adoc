= Requirements

VMware vSphere

[IMPORTANT]
====
Standalone ESXi is not supported.
====

* vSphere version 6.0.x minimum recommended version 6.7 U1b is required if you intend to support a complete link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Validated-Design/5.0.1/rn/vmware-validated-design-501-release-notes.html[VMware Validate Design].
* vSAN, VMFS and NFS supported.
** vSAN support is limited to one cluster in one vCenter.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} 3.11 is supported and deploys on vSphere 7 clusters. If you use the vSphere in-tree storage driver, vSAN, VMFS and NFS storage options are also supported. 
====

.Prerequisites

You must install the VMware Tools on each Node VM.
See
link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.html.hostclient.doc/GUID-ED3ECA21-5763-4919-8947-A819A17980FB.html[Installing VMware tools] for more information.

You can use the open source VMware `govmomi` CLI tool for additional
configuration and troubleshooting. For example, see the following `govc` CLI
configuration:
----
    export GOVC_URL='vCenter IP OR FQDN'
    export GOVC_USERNAME='vCenter User'
    export GOVC_PASSWORD='vCenter Password'
    export GOVC_INSECURE=1
----

[[vsphere-permissions]]
== Permissions

Create and assign roles to the vSphere Cloud Provider. A vCenter user with the required set of link:https://vmware.github.io/vsphere-storage-for-kubernetes/documentation/vcp-roles.html[privileges] is required.

In general, the vSphere user designated to the vSphere Cloud Provider must have the following permissions:

* `Read` permission on the parent entities of the node VMs such as `folder`,
`host`, datacenter, datastore folder, datastore cluster, and so on.
* `VirtualMachine.Inventory.Create/Delete` permission on the `vsphere.conf`
defined resource pool - this is used to create and delete test VMs.

See the link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-18071E9A-EED1-4968-8D51-E0B4F526FDA3.html[vSphere Documentation Center]
for steps to create a custom role, user, and role assignment.

vSphere Cloud Provider supports {product-title} clusters that span multiple vCenters. Make sure that all above privileges are correctly set for all vCenters.

.Dynamic provisioning permissions

[NOTE]
====
Dynamic persistent volume creation is the recommended practice.

.Static provisioning permissions

[NOTE]
====
Datastore.FileManagement is required for only the manage-k8s-volumes role,
if you create PVCs to bind with statically provisioned PVs and set the reclaim
policy to delete. When the PVC is deleted, associated statically provisioned PVs
are also deleted.

.Procedure

. Create link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-031BDB12-D3B2-4E2D-80E6-604F304B4D0C.html[a
VM folder] and move {product-title} Node VMs to this folder.

. Set the `disk.EnableUUID` parameter to `true` for each Node VM. This setting
ensures that the VMware vSphere's Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK) always presents a consistent UUID to the VM, allowing the disk to be mounted properly.
+
Every VM node that will be participating in the cluster must have the
`disk.EnableUUID` parameter set to `true`. To set this value, follow the steps
for either the vSphere console or `govc` CLI tool:
+
.. From the vSphere HTML Client navigate to *VM properties* -> *VM Options* -> *Advanced* -> *Configuration* *Parameters* -> *disk.enableUUID=TRUE*
+
.. Or using the govc CLI, find the Node VM paths:
+
[source,bash]
----
$govc ls /datacenter/vm/<vm-folder-name>
----

... Set `disk.EnableUUID` to `true` for all VMs:
+
[source,bash]
----
$govc vm.change -e="disk.enableUUID=1" -vm='VM Path'
----

[NOTE]
====
If {product-title} node VMs are created from a virtual machine template, then
you can set `disk.EnableUUID=1` on the template VM. VMs cloned from this
template inherit this property.
====

[[vsphere-vmotion]]
== Using {product-title} with vMotion
[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} generally supports compute-only vMotion. Using Storage vMotion can cause issues and is not supported.
====

If you are using vSphere volumes in your pods, migrating a VM across datastores either manually or through Storage vMotion causes invalid references within {product-title} persistent volume (PV) objects. These references prevent affected pods from starting up and can result in data loss.

Similarly, {product-title} does not support selective migration of VMDKs across datastores, using datastore clusters for VM provisioning or for dynamic or static provisioning of PVs, or using a datastore that is part of a datastore cluster for dynamic or static provisioning of PVs.
