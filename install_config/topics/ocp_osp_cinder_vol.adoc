==== OpenStack Cinder Volumes

OpenStack Block Storage provides persistent block storage management via the
`cinder` service. Block storage enables the OpenStack user to create a volume
that may be attached to different OpenStack instances. 


===== Docker Volume

The master and node instances contain a volume to store `docker` images. 
The purpose of the volume is to ensure that a large image or container does not
compromise node performance or abilities of the existing node.

NOTE: A docker volume of a minimum of 15GB is required for running containers.
This may need adjustment depending on the size and number of containers each
node will run. 


The docker volume is created by the OpenShift Ansible installer via the variable
`openshift_openstack_docker_volume_size`. More
information regarding changes required for the OpenShift Ansible installer are
described later. 

===== Registry volume

The OpenShift image registry requires a `cinder` volume to ensure that images are
saved in the event that the registry needs to migrate to another node. The
following steps show how to create the image registry via OpenStack. Once
the volume is created, the volume ID will be included in the OpenShift Ansible 
Installer _OSEv3.yml_ file via the parameter 
`openshift_hosted_registry_storage_openstack_volumeID` as described later.

NOTE: The registry volume size should be at least 30GB.

Verify the creation of the volume.
