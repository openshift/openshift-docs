==== Setting up DNS for {product-title}

DNS service is an important component in the {product-title} environment. Regardless of 
the provider of DNS, an organization is required to have certain records in 
place to serve the various {product-title} components.

[WARNING] 
====
Using `/etc/hosts` is not valid, a proper DNS service must exist.
====

Using the key secret of the DNS, you can provide the information
to the OpenShift Ansible Installer and it will automatically add A records for
the target instances and the various {product-title} components. This process setup
is described later when configuring the OpenShift Ansible Installer. 

Access to a DNS server is expected. You can use

assistance with access.

===== Application DNS

Applications served by OpenShift are accessible by the router on  ports 80/TCP
and 443/TCP.  The router uses a _wildcard_ record to map all host names under a
specific sub domain to the same IP address without requiring a separate record
for each name.

This allows {product-title} to add applications with arbitrary names as
long as they are under that sub domain.

For example, a wildcard record for `*.apps.example.com` causes DNS name lookups
for `tax.apps.example.com` and `home-goods.apps.example.com`
to both return the same IP address: `10.19.x.y`. All 
traffic is forwarded to the OpenShift Routers. The Routers examine the HTTP
headers of the queries and forward them to the correct destination.

With a load-balancer such as Octavia, host address of 10.19.x.y, the wildcard
DNS record can be added as follows:

.Load Balancer DNS records

|IP Address |Hostname |Purpose

|10.19.x.y
|`*.apps.example.com`
|User access to application web services
