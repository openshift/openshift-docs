= Configuring OpenShift Container Platform for OpenShift Container Storage 
Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) is a provider of agnostic persistent storage for OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) on-premise and in hybrid clouds, As a Red Hat storage solution, RHOCS is completely integrated with OCP for deployment, management and monitoring regardless if it is installed on top of OpenShift Container Platform (converged) or alongside OpenShift Container Platform (independent). OpenShihft Container Storage is not tied down to a single availability zone or node making it very attractive for surviving an outage. Complete instructions for using RHOCS can be found in the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_container_storage/3.10/html-single/deployment_guide/RHOCS[3.10 Deployment Guide].
