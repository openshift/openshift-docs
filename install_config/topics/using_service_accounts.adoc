= Using Service Accounts with the Red Hat Registry

Once you have created your service accounts and generated tokens for the Red Hat
Registry, you can perform additional tasks.

[NOTE]
====
This section provides the manual steps, which can be automatically performed
during installation by providing the inventory variables outlined in the
_Managing Registry Credentials for Installation and Upgrade_ section.
====

.Prerequisites

* User credentials
* Service account
* Service account token

.Procedure

From your link:https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Registry Service
Accounts] page, click on your account name. From there, you can perform the
following tasks:

* From the *Token Information* tab, you can view your username (the name you provided
 prepended with a random string) and password (token). From this tab, you can
 regenerate your token.
* From the *OpenShift Secret* tab, you can:
.. Download the secret by clicking the link in the tab.
.. Submit the secret to the cluster:
+
----
# oc create -f <account-name>-secret.yml --namespace=openshift
----
+
.. Update your Kubernetes configuration by adding a reference to the secret to
your Kubernetes pod configuration with an `imagePullSecrets` field, for example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: somepod
  namespace: all
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: web
      image: registry.redhat.io/REPONAME

    imagePullSecrets:
      - name: <numerical-string-account-name>-pull-secret
----
+
* From the *Docker Login* tab, you can run `docker login`. For example:
+
----
# docker login -u='<numerical-string|account-name>'
  -p=<token>
----
+
After you successfully log in, copy `~/.docker/config.json` to
`/var/lib/origin/.docker/config.json` and restart the node.
+
----
# cp -r ~/.docker /var/lib/origin/
  systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----
+
* From the *Docker Configuration* tab, you can:
.. Download the credentials configuration by clicking the link in the tab.
.. Write the configuration to the disk by placing the file in the Docker
configuration directory. This will overwrite existing credentials. For example:
+
----
# mv <account-name>-auth.json ~/.docker/config.json
----
