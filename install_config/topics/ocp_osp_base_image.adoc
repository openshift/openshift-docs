==== Creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Base Image

After the user and project are created, a cloud image is required for all the
{rhosp} instances that are to install {product-title}. For this particular reference
environment the image used is {rhel} {rhel_version}.

NOTE: {rhel} {rhel_version} includes support for overlay2 file system used in
this reference environment for container storage purposes. If using prior
{rhel} versions, do not use overlay2 file system.

The {rhel} {rhel_version} cloud image is located at https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/69/ver=/rhel---7/{rhel_version}/x86_64/product-software[Red Hat Enterprise Linux {rhel_version} KVM Guest Image]
Copy the image to the director or workstation node and store the image within
`glance`. https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/[Glance] image services provide the ability to discover, register
and retrieve virtual machine (VM) images.

NOTE: Depending on the _glance_ storage backend, it can be required to convert
the image format from _qcow2_ to a different format.
For _Ceph_ storage backends, it is https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2434691[required] the image to converted to _raw_
image format.

The following steps show the process of converting the_qcow2_ image to the
_raw_ format for the use of a _Ceph_ storage backend.

$ source /path/to/examplerc
$ mkdir ~/images
$ sudo cp /path/to/downloaded/rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 ~/images
$ cd ~/images
$ qemu-img convert \
    -f qcow2 -O raw \
    rhel-server-7.5-x86_64-kvm.qcow2 ./<img-name>.raw
$ openstack image create <img-name> \
    --disk-format=raw \
    --container-format=bare < <img-name>.raw

A {rhosp} administrator may allow this `glance` {rhel} image to be readily
available to all projects within the {rhosp} environment. This may be done by
`source` of an RC file with OpenStack administrator privileges that include the
 `--public` option prior to creating the `raw` image.

Confirm the creation of the image via `openstack image list`. An example output
is shown.
