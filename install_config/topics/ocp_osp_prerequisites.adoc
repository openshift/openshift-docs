=== {product-title} Prerequisites

A successful deployment of {product-title} requires many prerequisites. This consists of
a set of infrastructure and host configuration steps prior to the actual
installation of {product-title} using Ansible. In the following subsequent sections, details
regarding the prerequisites and configuration changes required for an {product-title} on a
OpenStack environment are discussed in detail.

NOTE: All the OpenStack CLI commands in this reference environment are executed
using the CLI `openstack` commands within the OpenStack director node. If using a 
workstation or laptop to execute these commands instead of the OpenStack
director node, please ensure to install the following packages found
within the specified repositories.

Example:

Enable the rhel-7-server-openstack-{rhosp_version}-rpms and Ansible repositories

----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
--enable rhel-7-server-openstack-13-rpms \
--enable=rhel-7-server-ansible-2.5-rpms
$ sudo yum install -y python-openstackclient python2-heatclient python2-octaviaclient ansible
----

Verify the packages are of at least the following versions (use `rpm -q <package_name>`):

* `python-openstackclient` - `3.14.1.-1`
* `python2-heatclient` `1.14.0-1`
* `python2-octaviaclient` `1.4.0-1`
* `ansible > 2.4.3` but less than version `2.6`.

NOTE: Ansible 2.6 requires `python2-openstacksdk` > 0.12.0 that is not part of
the {rhel} {rhel_version} distribution.
