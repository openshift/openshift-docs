=== {product-title} Prerequisites

A successful deployment of {product-title} requires many prerequisites. This consists of
a set of infrastructure and host configuration steps prior to the actual
installation of {product-title} using Ansible. In the following subsequent sections, details
regarding the prerequisites and configuration changes required for an {product-title} on a
OpenStack environment are discussed in detail.

[NOTE]
All of the OpenStack CLI commands in this reference environment are executed
using the CLI `openstack` commands within a different node from the director
node. The commands are executed in the other node to avoid package conflicts
with Ansible version 2.6 and above. Be sure to install the following packages
in the specified repositories.

Example:

Enable the rhel-7-server-openstack-{rhosp_version}-tools-rpms and the required
{product-title} repositories from
xref:../getting_started/install_openshift.adoc#set-up-repositories[Set Up
Repositories].

----
$ sudo subscription-manager repos \
--enable rhel-7-server-openstack-{rhosp_version}-tools-rpms \
--enable rhel-7-server-openstack-14-tools-rpms
$ sudo subscription-manager repo-override --repo=rhel-7-server-openstack-14-tools-rpms --add=includepkgs:"python2-openstacksdk.* python2-keystoneauth1.* python2-os-service-types.*"
$ sudo yum install -y python2-openstackclient python2-heatclient python2-octaviaclient ansible
----

Verify the packages are of at least the following versions (use `rpm -q <package_name>`):

* `python2-openstackclient` - `3.14.1.-1`
* `python2-heatclient` `1.14.0-1`
* `python2-octaviaclient` `1.4.0-1`
* `python2-openstacksdk` `0.17.2`
