==== Creating OpenStack User Accounts, Projects, and Roles

Before installing {product-title}, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)
environment requires a project, often referred to as a _tenant_,
that stores the OpenStack instances that are to install the {product-title}. This project
requires ownership by a user and the role of that user to be set to `\_member_`.

The following steps show how to accomplish the above.

As the OpenStack overcloud administrator,

. Create a project (tenant) that is to store the RHOSP instances
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack project create *<project>*
----
+
. Create a RHOSP user that has ownership of the previously created project:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack user create --password *<password> <username>*
----
+
. Set the role of the user:
+
----
$ openstack role add --user <username> --project <project> _member_
----

The default quotas assigned to new RH OSP projects are not high enough for
{product-title} installations. Increase the quotas to at least 30 security
groups, 200 security group rules, and 200 ports.
----
$ openstack quota set --secgroups 30 --secgroup-rules 200 --ports 200 <project>
<1>
----
<1> For `<project>`, specify the name of the project to modify

[[osp_accounts_kuryr]]
==== Extra steps for Kuryr SDN

If Kuryr SDN is enabled, especially if you are using namespace isolation,
increase your project's quotas to meet these minimum requirements:

* 300 security groups - one for each namespace plus one for each load balancer
* 150 networks - one for each namespace
* 150 subnets - one for each namespace
* 500 security group rules
* 500 ports - one port per Pod and additional ports for pools to speed up Pod
  creation

[NOTE]
====
This is not a global recommendation. Adjust your quotas to meet your requirements.
====

If you are using namespace isolation, each namespace is given a new network and
subnet. Additionally, a security group is created to enable traffic between
Pods in the namespace.

----
$ openstack quota set --networks 150 --subnets 150 --secgroups 300 --secgroup-rules 500 --ports 500 <project>
<1>
----
<1> For `<project>`, specify the name of the project to modify

If you enabled namespace isolation, you must add the project ID to the
`octavia.conf` configuration file after you create the project. This step
ensures that required LoadBalancer security groups belong to that project
and that they can be updated to enforce services isolation across namespaces.

[[env_file]]
==== Configuring the RC file

After you configure the project, an OpenStack administrator can create an RC
file with all the required information to the user(s) implementing the
{product-title} environment.

An example RC file:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ cat path/to/examplerc
# Clear any old environment that may conflict.
for key in $( set | awk '{FS="="}  /^OS_/ {print $1}' ); do unset $key ; done
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=*<project-name>*
export OS_USERNAME=*<username>*
export OS_PASSWORD=*<password>*
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://*<ip>*:5000//v3
export OS_CLOUDNAME=*<cloud-name>*
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3

# Add OS_CLOUDNAME to PS1
if [ -z "${CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED:-}" ]; then
	export PS1=${PS1:-""}
	export PS1=\${OS_CLOUDNAME:+"(\$OS_CLOUDNAME)"}\ $PS1
	export CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED=1
fi

----


[NOTE]
====
Changing _OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME and _OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME from the Default
value is supported as long as both reference the same domain.
====


As the user(s) implementing the {product-title} environment, within the OpenStack director
node or workstation, ensure to `source` the credentials as follows:

----
$ source path/to/examplerc
----
