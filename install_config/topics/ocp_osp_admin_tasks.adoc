==== Creating OpenStack User Accounts, Projects and Roles

Before installing {product-title}, the Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) 
environment requires a project, often referred to as a _tenant_,
that stores the OpenStack instances that are to install the {product-title}. This project
requires ownership by a user and role of that user to be set to `\_member_`.

The following steps show how to accomplish the above.

As the OpenStack overcloud administrator,

. Create a project (tenant) that is to store the RHOSP instances
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack project create *<project>*
----
+
. Create a RHOSP user that has ownership of the previously created project:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ openstack user create --password *<password> <username>*
----
+
. Set the role of the user:
+
----
$ openstack role add --user <username> --project <project> _member_
----

Once the above is complete, an OpenStack administrator can create an RC file
with all the required information to the user(s) implementing the {product-title}
environment.

An example RC file:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ cat path/to/examplerc
# Clear any old environment that may conflict.
for key in $( set | awk '{FS="="}  /^OS_/ {print $1}' ); do unset $key ; done
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=Default
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=*<project-name>*
export OS_USERNAME=*<username>*
export OS_PASSWORD=*<password>*
export OS_AUTH_URL=http://*<ip>*:5000//v3
export OS_CLOUDNAME=*<cloud-name>*
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3

# Add OS_CLOUDNAME to PS1
if [ -z "${CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED:-}" ]; then
	export PS1=${PS1:-""}
	export PS1=\${OS_CLOUDNAME:+"(\$OS_CLOUDNAME)"}\ $PS1
	export CLOUDPROMPT_ENABLED=1
fi

----

As the user(s) implementing the {product-title} environment, within the OpenStack director
node or workstation, ensure to `source` the credentials as follows:

----
$ source path/to/examplerc
----
