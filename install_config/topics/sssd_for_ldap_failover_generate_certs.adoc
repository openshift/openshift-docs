= Generating and sharing certificates with the remote basic authentication server

Complete the following steps on the first master host listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

. To ensure that communication between the remote basic authentication server and
{product-title} is trustworthy, create a set of Transport Layer Security (TLS)
certificates to use during the other phases of this set up. Run the following command:
+
----
# openshift start \
    --public-master=https://openshift.example.com:8443 \
    --write-config=/etc/origin/
----
+
The output inclues the *_/etc/origin/master/ca.crt_* and 
*_/etc/origin/master/ca.key_* signing certificates.
.  Use the signing certificate to generate keys to use on the remote basic
authentication server:
+
----
# mkdir -p /etc/origin/remote-basic/
# oc adm ca create-server-cert \
    --cert='/etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.crt' \
    --key='/etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.key' \
    --hostnames=remote-basic.example.com \ <1>
    --signer-cert='/etc/origin/master/ca.crt' \
    --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/ca.key' \
    --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt'
----
+
<1> A comma-separated list of all the host names and interface IP addresses that need to access the
remote basic authentication server.
+
[NOTE]
====
The certificate files that you generate are valid for two years. You can alter
this period by changing the `--expire-days` and `--signer-expire-days` values,
but for security reasons, do not make them greater than 730.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you do not list all host names and interface IP addresses that need to access the
remote basic authentication server, the HTTPS connection will fail.
====
. Copy the necessary certificates and key to the remote basic authentication server:
+
----
# scp /etc/origin/master/ca.crt \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/CA/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.crt \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/certs/

# scp /etc/origin/remote-basic/remote-basic.example.com.key \
      root@remote-basic.example.com:/etc/pki/tls/private/
