==== Create an OpenStack Flavor

Within OpenStack, flavors define the size of a virtual server by defining
the compute, memory, and storage capacity of `nova` computing instances. Since
the base image within this reference architecture is {rhel} {rhel_version}, a
`m1.node` and `m1.master` sized flavor is created with the following specifications as
shown in <<sys_req_ocp>>.

[[sys_req_ocp]]
.Minimum System Requirements for OpenShift
|===
|Node Type |CPU |RAM |Root Disk |Flavor

|Masters |4* |16** GB |45 GB |`m1.master`

|Nodes |1 |8 GB |20 GB |`m1.node`
|===

//TODO: Can't fix this from formatting.

\* Additional vCPU is recommended.

\\** Additional memory is recommended if etcd is co-located on masters.


As an OpenStack administrator,

----
$ openstack flavor create *<flavor_name>* \
    --id auto \
    --ram *<ram_in_MB>* \
    --disk *<disk_in_GB>* \
    --vcpus *<num_vcpus>*

An example below showing the creation of flavors within this reference
environment.

----
$ openstack flavor create m1.master \
    --id auto \
    --ram 16384 \
    --disk 45 \
    --vcpus 4
$ openstack flavor create m1.node \
    --id auto \
    --ram 8192 \
    --disk 20 \
    --vcpus 1
----

NOTE: If access to OpenStack administrator privileges to create new flavors
is unavailable, use existing flavors within the OpenStack environment
that meet the requirements in <<sys_req_ocp>>.

Verification of the OpenStack flavors via:

----
$ openstack flavor list
