= Configuring SSSD for LDAP failover
Complete these steps on the remote basic authentication server.

You can configure the SSSD to retrieve attributes, such as email addresses and
display names, and pass them to {product-title} to display in the web interface.
In the following steps, you configure the SSSD to provide email addresses to
{product-title}:

. Install the required SSSD and the web server components:
+
----
# yum install -y sssd \
                 sssd-dbus \
                 realmd \
                 httpd \
                 mod_session \
                 mod_ssl \
                 mod_lookup_identity \
                 mod_authnz_pam \
                 php \
                 mod_php
----

. Set up SSSD to authenticate this VM against the LDAP server. If the LDAP server
is a FreeIPA or Active Directory environment, then use *realmd* to join
this machine to the domain.
+
----
# realm join ldap.example.com
----
+
For more advanced cases, see the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/System-Level_Authentication_Guide/authconfig-ldap.html[System-Level Authentication Guide]

. To use SSSD to manage failover situations for LDAP, add more entries to the
 *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* file on the *ldap_uri* line. Systems that are
enrolled with FreeIPA can automatically handle failover by using DNS SRV records.

. Modify the *[domain/DOMAINNAME]* section of the *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* file
and add this attribute:
+
----
[domain/example.com]
...
ldap_user_extra_attrs = mail <1>
----
<1> Specify the correct attribute to retrieve email addresses for your LDAP
solution. For IPA, specify `mail`. Other LDAP solutions might use another
attribute, such as `email`.

. Confirm that the *_domain_* parameter in the *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* file
contains only the domain name listed in the *[domain/DOMAINNAME]* section.
+
----
domains = example.com
----

. Grant Apache permission to retrieve the email attribute. Add the following
lines to the *[ifp]* section of the *_/etc/sssd/sssd.conf_* file:
+
----
[ifp]
user_attributes = +mail
allowed_uids = apache, root
----

. To ensure that all of the changes are applied properly, restart SSSD:
+
----
$ systemctl restart sssd.service
----

. Test that the user information can be retrieved properly:
+
----
$ getent passwd <username>
username:*:12345:12345:Example User:/home/username:/usr/bin/bash
----

. Confirm that the mail attribute you specified returns an email address from
your domain:
+
----
# dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe \
    /org/freedesktop/sssd/infopipe org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.GetUserAttr \
    string:username \ <1>
    array:string:mail <2>

method return time=1528091855.672691 sender=:1.2787 -> destination=:1.2795 serial=13 reply_serial=2
   array [
      dict entry(
         string "mail"
         variant             array [
               string "username@example.com"
            ]
      )
   ]
----
<1> Provide a user name in your LDAP solution.
<2> Specify the attribute that you configured.

. Attempt to log in to the VM as an LDAP user and confirm that you can log in
using LDAP credentials. You can use either the local console or a remote service
like SSH to log in.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By default, all users can log in to the remote basic authentication server by using
their LDAP credentials. You can change this behavior:

* If you use IPA joined systems,
link:https://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/HBAC_and_allow_all[configure host-based access control].
* If you use Active Directory joined systems, use a
link:https://docs.pagure.org/SSSD.sssd/design_pages/active_directory_gpo_integration.html[group policy object].
* For other cases, see the
link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/sssd[SSSD configuration] documentation.
