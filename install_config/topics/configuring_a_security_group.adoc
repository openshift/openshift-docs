Configuring a Security Group

This module included in the following assemblies:
* install_config/configuring_aws.adoc
* install_config/configuring_openstack.adoc
////

These are some ports that you must have in your security
groups, without which the installation fails. You may need more depending on
the cluster configuration you want to install. For more information and to
adjust your security groups accordingly, see xref:../install/prerequisites.adoc#required-ports[Required Ports]
for more information.

for the ELBs appropriately.
