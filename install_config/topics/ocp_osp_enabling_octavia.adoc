==== Enabling Octavia: OpenStack Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS)

Octavia is a supported load balancer solution that is recommended to be used in
conjunction with {product-title} in order to load balance the external incoming traffic
and provide a single view of the {product-title} master services for the applications.

In order to enable Octavia, the Octavia service must be included during the
installation of the OpenStack overcloud or upgraded if the overcloud already exists.
The following steps provide basic non-custom steps in enabling Octavia and
apply to both either a clean install of the overcloud or an overcloud update.

NOTE: The following steps only capture the key pieces required during the
deployment of OpenStack when dealing with Octavia. For more information visit
the documentation of https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/[Installation of OpenStack]. It is also important to note that registry methods vary.
For more information visit the documentation on https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html/director_installation_and_usage/configuring-a-container-image-source#registry-methods[Registry Methods]. This example used the local
registry method.

If using the local registry, create a template to upload the images to the
registry. Example shown below.

----
(undercloud) $ openstack overcloud container image prepare \
-e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
--namespace=registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13 \
--push-destination=<local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787 \
--prefix=openstack- \
--tag-from-label {version}-{release} \
--output-env-file=/home/stack/templates/overcloud_images.yaml \
--output-images-file /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml
----

Verify that the created *_local_registry_images.yaml_* contains the Octavia images.

- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-api:13.0-43
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787

- imagename: registry.access.redhat.com/rhosp13/openstack-octavia-worker:13.0-44
  push_destination: <local-ip-from-undercloud.conf>:8787

[NOTE]
====
The versions of the Octavia containers will vary depending upon the specific Red
Hat OpenStack Platform 13 release installed.
====

The following step pulls the container images from registry.access.redhat.com
to the undercloud node. This may take soem time depending on the speed of the
network and undercloud disk.

----
(undercloud) $ sudo openstack overcloud container image upload \
  --config-file  /home/stack/local_registry_images.yaml \
  --verbose
----



Install or update your overcloud environment with Octavia:

----
openstack overcloud deploy --templates \
.
.
.
  -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services-docker/octavia.yaml \
.
.
.
----

[NOTE]
====
The command above only includes the files associated with Octavia. This command
will vary based upon your specifc installation of OpenStack. See the official
OpenStack documentation for further information. For more information on
customizing your Octavia installation, see
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/html-single/networking_guide/#planning_your_octavia_deployment[installation
of Octavia using Director].
