==== Creation of {product-title} Networks via OpenStack

When deploying {product-title} on {rhosp} as described in this segment,
the requirements are two networks -- _public_ and _internal_ network.

*Public Network*

The _public_ network is a network that contains external access and can be reached
by the outside world. The  _public_ network creation can be only done by an
OpenStack administrator.

The following commands provide an example of creating an OpenStack provider
network for _public_ network access.

As an OpenStack administrator (overcloudrc access),

----
$ source /path/to/examplerc

$ openstack network create *<public-net-name>* \
  --external \
  --provider-network-type flat \
  --provider-physical-network datacentre

$ openstack subnet create *<public-subnet-name>* \
  --network *<public-net-name>* \
  --dhcp \
  --allocation-pool start=*<float_start_ip>*,end=*<float_end_ip>* \
  --gateway *<ip>* \
  --subnet-range *<CIDR>*
----

Once the network and subnet have been created verify via:

----
$ openstack network list
$ openstack subnet list
----

[NOTE]
====
`<float_start_ip>` and `<float_end_ip>` are the associated floating IP pool provided to
the network labeled _public_ network. The Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
uses the format `<ip>/<routing_prefix>`, i.e. 10.0.0.1/24.
====

*Internal Network*

The _internal_ network is connected to the _public_ network via a router during
the network setup. This allows each {rhosp} instance attached to the
_internal_ network the ability to request a floating IP from the _public_ network
for public access. The _internal_ network is created automically by the OpenShift
Ansible installer via setting the `openshift_openstack_private_network_name`. More
information regarding changes required for the OpenShift Ansible installer are
described later.
