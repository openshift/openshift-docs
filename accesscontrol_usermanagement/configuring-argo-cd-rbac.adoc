By default, any type of user, except the `kube:admin` user, logged into the default Argo CD instance does not have access to any services. But a user logged into a custom Argo CD instance is a read-only user by default.

[NOTE]
====
In {gitops-title} v1.9.0 or earlier versions, any type of user, except the `kube:admin` user, logged into Argo CD using Red Hat SSO (RH SSO) is a read-only user by default.
