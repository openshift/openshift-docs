= Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster in AWS 
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: hcp-disaster-recovery-aws

toc::[]

You can recover a hosted cluster to the same region within {aws-first}. For example, you need disaster recovery when the upgrade of a management cluster fails and the hosted cluster is in a read-only state.

:FeatureName: Hosted control planes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

The disaster recovery process involves the following steps:

. Backing up the hosted cluster on the source management cluster
. Restoring the hosted cluster on a destination management cluster
. Deleting the hosted cluster from the source management cluster

Your workloads remain running during the process. The Cluster API might be unavailable for a period, but that does not affect the services that are running on the worker nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both the source management cluster and the destination management cluster must have the `--external-dns` flags to maintain the API server URL. That way, the server URL ends with `https://api-sample-hosted.sample-hosted.aws.openshift.com`. See the following example:

.Example: External DNS flags
[source,terminal]
----
--external-dns-provider=aws \
--external-dns-credentials=<path_to_aws_credentials_file> \
--external-dns-domain-filter=<basedomain>
----

If you do not include the `--external-dns` flags to maintain the API server URL, you cannot migrate the hosted cluster.
