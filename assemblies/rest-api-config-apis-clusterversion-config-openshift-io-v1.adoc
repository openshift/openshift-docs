== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`

| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec is the desired state of the cluster version - the operator will work to ensure that the desired version is applied to the cluster.

| `status`
| `object`
| status contains information about the available updates and any in-progress updates.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `capabilities`
| `object`
| capabilities configures the installation of optional, core cluster components.  A null value here is identical to an empty object; see the child properties for default semantics.

| `channel`
| `string`
| channel is an identifier for explicitly requesting that a non-default set of updates be applied to this cluster. The default channel will be contain stable updates that are appropriate for production clusters.

| `clusterID`
| `string`
| clusterID uniquely identifies this cluster. This is expected to be an RFC4122 UUID value (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx in hexadecimal values). This is a required field.

| `desiredUpdate`
| `object`
| desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if the current version does not match the desired version). The set of recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in status, and setting values outside that range may cause the upgrade to fail. 
 Some of the fields are inter-related with restrictions and meanings described here. 1. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 2. image is specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. You should not do this. version is silently ignored and image is used. 3. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 4. image is specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. image is used. 5. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is specified. version and desired architecture are used to select an image. 6. image is not specified, version is specified, architecture is not specified. version and current architecture are used to select an image. 7. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is specified. API validation error. 8. image is not specified, version is not specified, architecture is not specified. API validation error. 
 If an upgrade fails the operator will halt and report status about the failing component. Setting the desired update value back to the previous version will cause a rollback to be attempted. Not all rollbacks will succeed.

| `overrides`
| `array`
| overrides is list of overides for components that are managed by cluster version operator. Marking a component unmanaged will prevent the operator from creating or updating the object.

| `overrides[]`
| `object`
| ComponentOverride allows overriding cluster version operator's behavior for a component.

| `upstream`
| `string`
| upstream may be used to specify the preferred update server. By default it will use the appropriate update server for the cluster and region.

| `capabilities`
| `object`
| capabilities describes the state of optional, core cluster components.

| `conditionalUpdates`
| `array`
| conditionalUpdates contains the list of updates that may be recommended for this cluster if it meets specific required conditions.

| `history[]`
| `object`
| UpdateHistory is a single attempted update to the cluster.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
