You can manage automatic updates for the following boot sources:

* xref:managing-rh-boot-source-updates_virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[All Red Hat boot sources]
* xref:managing-custom-boot-source-updates_virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[All custom boot sources]
* xref:virt-disable-auto-updates-single-boot-source_virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[Individual Red Hat or custom boot sources]

Boot sources can make virtual machine (VM) creation more accessible and efficient for users. If automatic boot source updates are enabled, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports, polls, and updates the images so that they are ready to be cloned for new VMs. By default, CDI automatically updates Red Hat boot sources.

== Managing Red Hat boot source updates

You can opt out of automatic updates for all system-defined boot sources by disabling the `enableCommonBootImageImport` feature gate. If you disable this feature gate, all `DataImportCron` objects are deleted. This does not remove previously imported boot source objects that store operating system images, though administrators can delete them manually.

When the `enableCommonBootImageImport` feature gate is disabled, `DataSource` objects are reset so that they no longer point to the original boot source. An administrator can manually provide a boot source by creating a new persistent volume claim (PVC) or volume snapshot for the `DataSource` object, then populating it with an operating system image.

== Managing custom boot source updates

_Custom_ boot sources that are not provided by {VirtProductName} are not controlled by the feature gate. You must manage them individually by editing the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR).

====
You must configure a storage class. Otherwise, the cluster cannot receive automated updates for custom boot sources. See xref:../../post_installation_configuration/storage-configuration.adoc#defining-storage-classes_post-install-storage-configuration[Defining a storage class] for details.

You must configure a storage profile. Otherwise, the cluster cannot receive automated updates for custom boot sources. See xref:virt-configuring-storage-profile[Configure storage profiles] for details.
