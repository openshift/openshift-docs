= About Operator installation with OperatorHub

OperatorHub is a user interface for discovering Operators; it works in conjunction with Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), which installs and manages Operators on a cluster.

ifndef::olm-user,openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
As a cluster administrator, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
web console or CLI. Subscribing an Operator to one or more namespaces makes the Operator available to developers on your cluster.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
As a `dedicated-admin`, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console or CLI. Subscribing an Operator to one or more namespaces makes the Operator available to developers on your cluster.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]

ifdef::olm-user[]
As a user with the proper permissions, you can install an Operator from OperatorHub by using the {product-title} web console or CLI.
endif::[]

During installation, you must determine the following initial settings for the Operator:

ifndef::olm-user[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin,openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
Installation Mode:: Choose *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* to have the Operator installed on all namespaces or choose individual namespaces, if available, to only install the Operator on selected namespaces. This example chooses *All namespaces...* to make the Operator available to all users and projects.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::olm-user[]
Installation Mode:: Choose a specific namespace in which to install the Operator.
endif::[]

Update Channel:: If an Operator is available through multiple channels, you can choose which channel you want to subscribe to. For example, to deploy from the *stable* channel, if available, select it from the list.

Approval Strategy:: You can choose automatic or manual updates.
+
If you choose automatic updates for an installed Operator, when a new version of that Operator is available in the selected channel, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically upgrades the running instance of your Operator without human intervention.
+
If you select manual updates, when a newer version of an Operator is available, OLM creates an update request. As a
ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
cluster administrator,
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
`dedicated-admin`,
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
you must then manually approve that update request to have the Operator updated to the new version.
