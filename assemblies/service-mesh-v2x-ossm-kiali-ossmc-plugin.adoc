The {SMPlugin} is an extension to the {product-title} web console that provides visibility into your Service Mesh. With the OSSMC plugin installed, a new *Service Mesh* menu option is available in the navigation menu on the left side of the web console, as well as new *Service Mesh* tabs that enhance the existing *Workloads* and *Services* console pages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using a certificate that your browser does not initially trust, you must tell your browser to trust the certificate first before you are able to access the {SMPluginShort}. To do this, go to the Kiali standalone user interface (UI) and tell the browser to accept its certificate.
