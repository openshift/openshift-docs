= Cluster autoscaling settings using OpenShift Cluster Manager

The tables explain all the configurable UI settings when using cluster autoscaling with OpenShift Cluster Manager.

.Configurable general settings for cluster autoscaling when using the OpenShift Cluster Manager

== General settings

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`log-verbosity`
|Sets the autoscaler log level. The default value is 1. Level 4 is recommended for debugging. Level 6 enables almost everything.
|`integer`
|1

|`skip-nodes-with-local-storage`
|If `true`, the cluster autoscaler never deletes nodes with pods with local storage, e.g. EmptyDir or HostPath.
|`boolean`
|true

|`max-pod-grace-period`
|Gives pods graceful termination time in seconds before scaling down.
|`integer`
|600

|`max-node-provision-time`
|Maximum time the cluster autoscaler waits for nodes to be provisioned.
|`string`
|15m

|`pod-priority-threshold`
|Allows users to schedule "best-effort" pods, which are not expected to trigger cluster autoscaler actions. These pods only run when spare resources are available.
|`integer`
|-10

|`ignore-daemonsets-utilization`
|Determines whether the cluster autoscaler ignores daemon set pods when calculating resource utilization for scaling down.
|`boolean`
|false

|`balance-similar-node-groups`
|If `true`, this setting automatically identifies node groups with the same instance type and the same set of labels and tries to keep the respective sizes of those node groups balanced.
|`boolean`
|false

|`balancing-ignored-labels`
|This option specifies labels that the cluster autoscaler should ignore when considering node group similarity. This option cannot contain spaces.
|`array (string)`
|Format should be a comma-separated list of labels.
|===

.Configurable resource limit settings for cluster autoscaling when using the OpenShift Cluster Manager

== Resource limits

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`cores-total-min`
|Minimum number of cores in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster less than this number.
|`object`
|0

|`cores-total-max`
|Maximum number of cores in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster greater than this number.
|`object`
|180 * 64 (11520)

|`memory-total-min`
|Minimum number of gigabytes of memory in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster less than this number.
|`object`
|0

|`memory-total-max`
|Maximum number of gigabytes of memory in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster greater than this number.
|`object`
|180 * 64 * 20 (230400)

|`max-nodes-total`
|Maximum number of nodes in all node groups. Includes all nodes, not just automatically scaled nodes. The cluster autoscaler does not grow the cluster greater than this number.
|`integer`
|180

|GPUs
|Minimum and maximum number of different GPUs in cluster. The cluster autoscaler does not scale the cluster less than or greater than these numbers.
|`array`
|Format should be a comma-separated list of "<gpu_type>:<min>:<max>".
|===


.Configurable scale down settings for cluster autoscaling when using the OpenShift Cluster Manager

== Scale down configuration

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Setting
|Description
|Type or Range
|Default

|`scale-down-enabled`
|Should the cluster autoscaler scale down the cluster.
|`boolean`
|true

|`scale-down-utilization-threshold`
|Node utilization level, defined as the sum of the requested resources divided by capacity, below which a node can be considered for scale down.
|`float`
|0.5

|`scale-down-unneeded-time`
|How long a node should be unneeded before it is eligible for scale down.
|`string`
|10m

|`scale-down-delay-after-add`
|How long after scale up that scale-down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|10m

|`scale-down-delay-after-delete`
|How long after node deletion that scale-down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|0s

|`scale-down-delay-after-failure`
|How long after scale down failure that scale-down evaluation resumes.
|`string`
|3m
