xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-ovn-secondary-network[Connecting a virtual machine to an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network]::

You can connect a VM to an Open Virtual Network (OVN)-Kubernetes secondary network. {VirtProductName} supports the layer 2 and localnet topologies for OVN-Kubernetes.
+
--
* A layer 2 topology connects workloads by a cluster-wide logical switch. The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in uses the Geneve (Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation) protocol to create an overlay network between nodes. You can use this overlay network to connect VMs on different nodes, without having to configure any additional physical networking infrastructure.

* A localnet topology connects the secondary network to the physical underlay. This enables both east-west cluster traffic and access to services running outside the cluster, but it requires additional configuration of the underlying Open vSwitch (OVS) system on cluster nodes.

To configure an OVN-Kubernetes secondary network and attach a VM to that network, perform the following steps:

* xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#using-virtctl-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl ssh` command]
+
You create an SSH key pair, add the public key to a VM, and connect to the VM by running the `virtctl ssh` command with the private key.
+
You can add public SSH keys to {op-system-base-full} 9 VMs at runtime or at first boot to VMs with guest operating systems that can be configured by using a cloud-init data source.

* xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#virt-using-virtctl-port-forward-command_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl port-forward` command]
+
You add the `virtctl port-foward` command to your `.ssh/config` file and connect to the VM by using OpenSSH.

* xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virt-accessing-vm-ssh.adoc#using-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Service]
+
You create a service, associate the service with the VM, and connect to the IP address and port exposed by the service.

+
You configure a secondary network, attach a VM to the secondary network interface, and connect to its allocated IP address.
