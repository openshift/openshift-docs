toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can convert your IPv4 single-stack cluster to a dual-network cluster network that supports IPv4 and IPv6 address families. After converting to dual-stack networking, new and existing pods have dual-stack networking enabled.

Clusters provisioned on bare metal, {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name} infrastructure, {sno}, and {vmw-full} support dual-stack networking.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using dual-stack networking where IPv6 is required, you cannot use IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, such as `::FFFF:198.51.100.1`.
