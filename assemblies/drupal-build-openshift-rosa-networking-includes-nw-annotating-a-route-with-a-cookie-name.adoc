= Annotating a route with a cookie

You can set a cookie name to overwrite the default, auto-generated one for the route. This allows the application receiving route traffic to know the cookie name. By deleting the cookie it can force the next request to re-choose an endpoint. So, if a server was overloaded it tries to remove the requests from the client and redistribute them.

.Procedure

. Annotate the route with the specified cookie name:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate route <route_name> router.openshift.io/cookie_name="<cookie_name>"
----
+
--
where:

`<route_name>`:: Specifies the name of the route.
`<cookie_name>`:: Specifies the name for the cookie.
--
+
For example, to annotate the route `my_route` with the cookie name `my_cookie`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate route my_route router.openshift.io/cookie_name="my_cookie"
----

. Capture the route hostname in a variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ROUTE_NAME=$(oc get route <route_name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----
+
--
where:

`<route_name>`:: Specifies the name of the route.
--

. Save the cookie, and then access the route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl $ROUTE_NAME -k -c /tmp/cookie_jar
----
+
Use the cookie saved by the previous command when connecting to the route:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl $ROUTE_NAME -k -b /tmp/cookie_jar
----
