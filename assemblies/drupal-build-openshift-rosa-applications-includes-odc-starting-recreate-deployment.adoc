= Starting a recreate deployment using the Developer perspective

You can switch the deployment strategy from the default rolling update to a recreate update using the *Developer* perspective in the web console.

.Prerequisites
* Ensure that you are in the *Developer* perspective of the web console.
* Ensure that you have created an application using the *Add* view and see it deployed in the *Topology* view.

.Procedure

To switch to a recreate update strategy and to upgrade an application:

. Click your application to see the *Details* panel.
. In the *Actions* drop-down menu, select *Edit Deployment Config* to see the deployment configuration details of the application.
. In the YAML editor, change the `spec.strategy.type` to `Recreate` and click *Save*.
. In the *Topology* view, select the node to see the *Overview* tab in the side panel. The *Update Strategy* is now set to *Recreate*.
. Use the *Actions* drop-down menu to select *Start Rollout* to start an update using the recreate strategy. The recreate strategy first terminates pods for the older version of the application and then spins up pods for the new version.
