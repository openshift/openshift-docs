= Configuring SSH access to virtual machines

:toclevels: 3


You can configure SSH access to virtual machines (VMs) by using the following methods:

* xref:using-virtctl-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl ssh` command]
+
You create an SSH key pair, add the public key to a VM, and connect to the VM by running the `virtctl ssh` command with the private key.
+
You can add public SSH keys to {op-system-base-full} 9 VMs at runtime or at first boot to VMs with guest operating systems that can be configured by using a cloud-init data source.

* xref:virt-using-virtctl-port-forward-command_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[`virtctl port-forward` command]
+
You add the `virtctl port-foward` command to your `.ssh/config` file and connect to the VM by using OpenSSH.

* xref:using-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Service]
+
You create a service, associate the service with the VM, and connect to the IP address and port exposed by the service.

* xref:using-secondary-networks-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Secondary network]
+
You configure a secondary network, attach a virtual machine (VM) to the secondary network interface, and connect to the DHCP-allocated IP address.

== Using virtctl ssh

You can add a public SSH key to a virtual machine (VM) and connect to the VM by running the `virtctl ssh` command.

This method is simple to configure. However, it is not recommended for high traffic loads because it places a burden on the API server.

include::../includes/virt-about-static-and-dynamic-ssh-keys.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="static-key-management-vm"]
=== Static key management

You can add a statically managed public SSH key when you create a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console or the command line. The key is added as a cloud-init data source when the VM boots for the first time.

[TIP]
====
You can also add the key to a project by using the {product-title} web console. Afterwards, this key is added automatically to VMs that you create in the project.

[id="adding-dynamic-key-vm"]
=== Dynamic key management

You can enable dynamic key injection for a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console or the command line. Then, you can update the key at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
Only {op-system-base-full} 9 supports dynamic key injection.
====

If you disable dynamic key injection, the VM inherits the key management method of the image from which it was created.

[id="using-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh"]
== Using a service for SSH access

You can create a service for a virtual machine (VM) and connect to the IP address and port exposed by the service.

Services provide excellent performance and are recommended for applications that are accessed from outside the cluster or within the cluster. Ingress traffic is protected by firewalls.

If the cluster network cannot handle the traffic load, consider using a secondary network for VM access.

include::../includes/virt-about-services.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="creating-services-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh"]
=== Creating a service

You can create a service to expose a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console, `virtctl` command line tool, or a YAML file.

include::../includes/virt-creating-service-web.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

include::../includes/virt-creating-service-virtctl.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

.Next steps

After you create a service with `virtctl`, you must add `special: key` to the `spec.template.metadata.labels` stanza of the `VirtualMachine` manifest. See xref:virt-creating-service-cli_virt-accessing-vm-ssh[Creating a service by using the command line].

[id="using-secondary-networks-ssh_virt-accessing-vm-ssh"]
== Using a secondary network for SSH access

You can configure a secondary network, attach a virtual machine (VM) to the secondary network interface, and connect to the DHCP-allocated IP address by using SSH.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Secondary networks provide excellent performance because the traffic is not handled by the cluster network stack. However, the VMs are exposed directly to the secondary network and are not protected by firewalls. If a VM is compromised, an intruder could gain access to the secondary network. You must configure appropriate security within the operating system of the VM if you use this method.
