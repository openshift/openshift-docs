== Purpose
endif::[]

_Operator Lifecycle Manager_ (OLM) helps users install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes native applications (Operators) and their associated services running across their {product-title} clusters. It is part of the link:https://operatorframework.io/[Operator Framework], an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

OLM runs by default in {product-title} {product-version}, which aids

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster. The {product-title} web console provides management screens for

cluster administrators

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
`dedicated-admin` administrators
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
If an Operator requires any of the following APIs, then you must enable the `OperatorLifecycleManager` capability:

* `ClusterServiceVersion` 
* `CatalogSource`
* `Subscription`
* `InstallPlan`
* `OperatorGroup`

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `marketplace` capability depends on the `OperatorLifecycleManager` capability. You cannot disable the `OperatorLifecycleManager` capability and enable the `marketplace` capability.
