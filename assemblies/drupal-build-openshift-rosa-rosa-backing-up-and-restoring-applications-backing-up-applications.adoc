You can employ OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters to backup and restore application data. Before installing OADP, you must set up role and policy credentials for OADP so that it can use the AWS API.

This is a two stage process:

. Prepare AWS credentials.
. Install the OADP Operator and provide it with the IAM role.
