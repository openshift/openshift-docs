:context: binding-workloads-using-sbo


Application developers must bind a workload to one or more backing services by using a binding secret. This secret is generated for the purpose of storing information to be consumed by the workload.

As an example, consider that the service you want to connect to is already exposing the binding data. In this case, you would also need a workload to be used along with the `ServiceBinding` custom resource (CR). By using this `ServiceBinding` CR, the workload sends a binding request with the details of the services to bind with.

.Example of `ServiceBinding` CR

----
<1> Specifies a list of service resources.
<2> The sample application that points to a Deployment or any other similar resource with an embedded PodSpec.

As shown in the previous example, you can also directly use a `ConfigMap` or a `Secret` itself as a service resource to be used as a source of binding data.
