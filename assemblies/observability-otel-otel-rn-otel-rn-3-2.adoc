[id="otel-rn_3-2_jaeger-release-notes_deprecated-functionality"]
== Deprecated functionality

In {OTELName} 3.2, use of empty values and `null` keywords in the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource is deprecated and planned to be unsupported in a future release. Red Hat will provide bug fixes and support for this syntax during the current release lifecycle, but this syntax will become unsupported. As an alternative to empty values and `null` keywords, you can update the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource to contain empty JSON objects as open-closed braces `{}` instead.

[id="otel-rn_3-2_removal-notice"]
== Removal notice

In the {OTELName} 3.2, the FEATURE has been removed. Bug fixes and support are provided only through the end of the 3.? lifecycle. As an alternative to the FEATURE for USE CASE, you can use the ALTERNATIVE instead.

[id="otel-rn_3-2_bug-fixes"]
== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fix:

* Before this update, the checkbox to enable Operator monitoring was not available in the web console when installing the {OTELOperator}. As a result, a *ServiceMonitor* resource was not created in the `openshift-opentelemetry-operator` namespace. With this update, the checkbox appears for the {OTELOperator} in the web console so that Operator monitoring can be enabled during installation.
