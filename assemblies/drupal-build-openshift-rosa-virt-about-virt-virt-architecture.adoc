= {VirtProductName} Architecture
:context: virt-architecture


The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) deploys operator pods for each component of {VirtProductName}:

* Compute: `virt-operator`
* Storage: `cdi-operator`
* Network: `cluster-network-addons-operator`
* Scaling: `ssp-operator`
* Templating: `tekton-tasks-operator`

OLM also deploys the `hyperconverged-cluster-operator` pod, which is responsible for the deployment, configuration, and life cycle of other components, and several helper pods: `hco-webhook`, and `hyperconverged-cluster-cli-download`.

After all operator pods are successfully deployed, you should create the `HyperConverged` custom resource (CR). The configurations set in the `HyperConverged` CR serve as the single source of truth and the entrypoint for {VirtProductName}, and guide the behavior of the CRs.

The `HyperConverged` CR creates corresponding CRs for the operators of all other components within its reconciliation loop. Each operator then creates resources such as daemon sets, config maps, and additional components for the {VirtProductName} control plane. For example, when the HyperConverged Operator (HCO) creates the `KubeVirt` CR, the {VirtProductName} Operator reconciles it and creates additional resources such as `virt-controller`, `virt-handler`, and `virt-api`.

The OLM deploys the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator, but it is not functional until you create a `hostpath-provisioner` CR.
