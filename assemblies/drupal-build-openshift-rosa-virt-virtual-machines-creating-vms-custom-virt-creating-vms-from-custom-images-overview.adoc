You can create virtual machines (VMs) from custom operating system images by using one of the following methods:

* xref:virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[Importing the image as a container disk from a registry].
+
Optional: You can enable auto updates for your container disks. See xref:virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[Managing automatic boot source updates] for details.

* xref:virt-creating-vms-from-web-images[Importing the image from a web page].
* xref:virt-creating-vms-uploading-images[Uploading the image from a local machine].
* xref:virt-creating-vms-by-cloning-pvcs[Cloning a persistent volume claim (PVC) that contains the image].

The Containerized Data Importer (CDI) imports the image into a PVC by using a data volume. You add the PVC to the VM by using the {product-title} web console or command line.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the xref:virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

You must also install xref:installing-virtio-drivers[VirtIO drivers] on Windows VMs.

The QEMU guest agent is included with Red Hat images.
