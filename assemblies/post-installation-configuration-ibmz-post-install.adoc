= Configuring additional devices in an {ibm-z-title} or {ibm-linuxone-title} environment

toc::[]

After installing {product-title}, you can configure additional devices for your cluster in an {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} environment, which is installed with z/VM. The following devices can be configured:

* Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP) host
* FCP LUN
* DASD
* qeth

You can configure devices by adding udev rules using the Machine Config Operator (MCO) or you can configure devices manually.

[NOTE]
====
The procedures described here apply only to z/VM installations. If you have installed your cluster with {op-system-base} KVM on {ibm-z-name} or {ibm-linuxone-name} infrastructure, no additional configuration is needed inside the KVM guest after the devices were added to the KVM guests. However, both in z/VM and {op-system-base} KVM environments the next steps to configure the Local Storage Operator and Kubernetes NMState Operator need to be applied.

[id="roce-network-cards"]
== RoCE network Cards
RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) network cards do not need to be enabled and their interfaces can be configured with the Kubernetes NMState Operator whenever they are available in the node. For example, RoCE network cards are available if they are attached in a z/VM environment or passed through in a {op-system-base} KVM environment.
