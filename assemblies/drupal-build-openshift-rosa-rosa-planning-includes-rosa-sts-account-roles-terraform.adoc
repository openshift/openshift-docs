= Creating your account-wide IAM roles with Terraform
endif::tf-full[]

The following example shows how Terraform can be used to create your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) account roles for ROSA.

include::./terraform-modification-disclaimer.adoc[]

.Procedure

. Check your AWS account for existing roles and policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list account-roles
----
+

. In your terminal, run the following command to export link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[your {cluster-manager-first} token]. This value must include the full {cluster-manager} token:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export RHCS_TOKEN="<your_offline_token>"
----
+
You can verify that your token is saved by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $RHCS_TOKEN
----
+
You see your token in the command line.

. Optional: You can specify your own account-role prefix that prepends the roles you create by running the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
If you do not specify an account-role prefix, a prefix is generated in the format of `account-role-` followed by a string of four random characters.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export TF_VAR_account_role_prefix=<account_role_prefix>
----

. Create the Terraform files locally by using the following code templates:
+
[NOTE]
====
These files are created in your current directory. Ensure that you are in the directory where you want to run Terraform.
====

.. The `main.tf` file calls the Red Hat Cloud Services Terraform provider, which allows you to use OpenShift services with Terraform. Run the following command to create the `main.tf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat<<-EOF>main.tf

----

.. You define the account role prefix structure in the `output.tf` file. This output definition allows you to specify how the various generated roles are constructed. Run the following command to create your `output.tf` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat<<-EOF>output.tf
  output "account_role_prefix" {
    value = module.create_account_roles.account_role_prefix
  }
EOF
----

.. The `variables.tf` allows you to specify values you want for select variables. If you exported a variable for the `account_role_prefix` earlier, leave this variable's default value blank. Setting the variable in both places with different values can produce unexpected results. Run the following command to create your `variables.tf` file:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not include your {cluster-manager} token in this file if it is not stored in a safe location.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat<<-EOF>variables.tf

    type = string

For example, if you plan to create a ROSA cluster using '4.13.10', then this version should be '4.13'. You can see the supported versions of OpenShift by running 'rosa list version'."
  }

  variable "account_role_prefix" {
    type    = string

--
<1> The `tags` parameter uses a map of strings variable. The format that it takes looks like the following example:
+
[source,terraform]
----
variable "tags" {
  type    = "map"
  default = {
    "us-east-1" = "image-1234"
    "us-west-2" = "image-4567"
  }
}
----
--
. In the directory where you saved these Terraform files, run the following command to set up Terraform to create these resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform init
----
. Optional: Run the following command to confirm that the Terraform code you copied is correct:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform validate
----
+
.Sample output
+
[source,terminal]
----
Success! The configuration is valid.
----
. Optional: Test your Terraform template and create a reusable Terraform plan file by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform plan -out account-roles.tfplan
----
. Run the following command to build your account-wide IAM roles with Terraform:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform apply "account-roles.tfplan"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you used the `terraform plan` command first, you can provide your created `account-roles.tf` file here. Otherwise, Terraform temporarily creates this plan before it applies your desired outcome.
====

.Verification
* Run the following command to verify that your account-roles have been created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list account-roles
----

.Clean up

When you are finished using the resources that you created using Terraform, you should purge these resources with the following command:
[source,terminal]

$ terraform destroy
