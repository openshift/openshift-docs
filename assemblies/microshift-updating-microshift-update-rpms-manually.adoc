Updating {product-title} for non-OSTree systems such as {op-system-base-full} requires downloading then updating the RPMs. For patch releases, such as 4.16.1 to 4.16.2, download and update the RPMs. For minor-version release updates, add the step of enabling the update repository using your subscription manager.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{microshift-short} updates are supported with a maximum of two minor versions. For example, you can update to 4.16 from 4.14 in a single step. Updating 4.14 to 4.15 first is not required.

[NOTE]
====
You can back up application data as needed and move the data copy to a secure location when using any update type.
