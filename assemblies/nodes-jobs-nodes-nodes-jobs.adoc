A _job_ executes a task in your {product-title} cluster.

A job tracks the overall progress of a task and updates its status with information
about active, succeeded, and failed pods. Deleting a job will clean up any pod
replicas it created. Jobs are part of the Kubernetes API, which can be managed
with `oc` commands like other object types.

.Sample Job specification

      restartPolicy: OnFailure    <6>
#...
