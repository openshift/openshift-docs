= Adding Docker build arguments

You can set link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg[Docker build arguments] using the `buildArgs` array. The build arguments are passed to Docker when a build is started.

See link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact[Understand how ARG and FROM interact] in the Dockerfile reference documentation.

* To set Docker build arguments, add entries to the `buildArgs` array, which is located in the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  buildArgs:
    - name: "version"
      value: "latest"
----
+
[NOTE]

Only the `name` and `value` fields are supported. Any settings on the `valueFrom` field are ignored.
