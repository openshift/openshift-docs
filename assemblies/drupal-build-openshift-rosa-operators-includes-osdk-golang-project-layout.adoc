|File or directory |Purpose

|`main.go`
|Main program of the Operator. This instantiates a new manager that registers all custom resource definitions (CRDs) in the `apis/` directory and starts all controllers in the `controllers/` directory.

|`apis/`
|Directory tree that defines the APIs of the CRDs. You must edit the `apis/<version>/<kind>_types.go` files to define the API for each resource type and import these packages in your controllers to watch for these resource types.

|`controllers/`
|Controller implementations. Edit the `controller/<kind>_controller.go` files to define the reconcile logic of the controller for handling a resource type of the specified kind.

|`config/`
|Kubernetes manifests used to deploy your controller on a cluster, including CRDs, RBAC, and certificates.

|`Makefile`
|Targets used to build and deploy your controller.

|`Dockerfile`
|Instructions used by a container engine to build your Operator.

|`manifests/`
|Kubernetes manifests for registering CRDs, setting up RBAC, and deploying the Operator as a deployment.
