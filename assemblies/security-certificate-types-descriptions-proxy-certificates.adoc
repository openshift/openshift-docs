== Purpose

Proxy certificates allow users to specify one or more custom certificate authority (CA) certificates used by platform components when making egress connections.

The `trustedCA` field of the Proxy object is a reference to a config map that contains a user-provided trusted certificate authority (CA) bundle. This bundle is merged with the {op-system-first} trust bundle and injected into the trust store of platform components that make egress HTTPS calls. For example, `image-registry-operator` calls an external image registry to download images. If `trustedCA` is not specified, only the {op-system} trust bundle is used for proxied HTTPS connections. Provide custom CA certificates to the {op-system} trust bundle if you want to use your own certificate infrastructure.

The `trustedCA` field should only be consumed by a proxy validator. The validator is responsible for reading the certificate bundle from required key `ca-bundle.crt` and copying it to a config map named `trusted-ca-bundle` in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. The namespace for the config map referenced by `trustedCA` is `openshift-config`:

[source,yaml]

== Managing proxy certificates during installation

The `additionalTrustBundle` value of the installer configuration is used to specify any proxy-trusted CA certificates during installation. For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat install-config.yaml
----

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
...
proxy:
  httpProxy: http://<https://username:password@proxy.example.com:123/>
  httpsProxy: https://<https://username:password@proxy.example.com:123/>
	noProxy: <123.example.com,10.88.0.0/16>
additionalTrustBundle: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
   <MY_HTTPS_PROXY_TRUSTED_CA_CERT>
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
...
----

== Location

The user-provided trust bundle is represented as a config map. The config map is mounted into the file system of platform components that make egress HTTPS calls. Typically, Operators mount the config map to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`, but this is not required by the proxy. A proxy can modify or inspect the HTTPS connection. In either case, the proxy must generate and sign a new certificate for the connection.

Complete proxy support means connecting to the specified proxy and trusting any signatures it has generated. Therefore, it is necessary to let the user specify a trusted root, such that any certificate chain connected to that trusted root is also trusted.

If using the RHCOS trust bundle, place CA certificates in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-shared-system-certificates_security-hardening[Using shared system certificates] in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux documentation for more information.

== Expiration

The user sets the expiration term of the user-provided trust bundle.

The default expiration term is defined by the CA certificate itself. It is up to the CA administrator to configure this for the certificate before it can be used by {product-title} or {op-system}.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not monitor for when CAs expire. However, due to the long life of CAs, this is generally not an issue. However, you might need to periodically update the trust bundle.
====

== Services

By default, all platform components that make egress HTTPS calls will use the {op-system} trust bundle. If `trustedCA` is defined, it will also be used.

Any service that is running on the {op-system} node is able to use the trust bundle of the node.

== Management

These certificates are managed by the system and not the user.

== Customization

Updating the user-provided trust bundle consists of either:

* updating the PEM-encoded certificates in the config map referenced by `trustedCA,` or
* creating a config map in the namespace `openshift-config` that contains the new trust bundle and updating `trustedCA` to reference the name of the new config map.

The mechanism for writing CA certificates to the {op-system} trust bundle is exactly the same as writing any other file to {op-system}, which is done through the use of machine configs. When the Machine Config Operator (MCO) applies the new machine config that contains the new CA certificates, it runs the program `update-ca-trust` afterwards and restarts the CRI-O service on the {op-system} nodes. This update does not require a node reboot. Restarting the CRI-O service automatically updates the trust bundle with the new CA certificates. For example:

The trust store of machines must also support updating the trust store of nodes.

== Renewal

There are no Operators that can auto-renew certificates on the {op-system} nodes.
