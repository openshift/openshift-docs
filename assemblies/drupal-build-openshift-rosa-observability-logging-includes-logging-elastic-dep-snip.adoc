[NOTE]
====
The {logging-uc} 5.9 release does not contain an updated version of the {es-op}. If you currently use the {es-op} released with {logging-uc} 5.8, it will continue to work with {logging-uc} until the EOL of {logging-uc} 5.8. As an alternative to using the {es-op} to manage the default log storage, you can use the {loki-op}. For more information on the {logging-uc} lifecycle dates, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift_operators#platform-agnostic[Platform Agnostic Operators].
