Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) has been included with {product-title} 4 since its initial release. {product-title} 4.14 introduces components for a next-generation iteration of OLM as a Technology Preview feature, known during this phase as _{olmv1}_. This updated framework evolves many of the concepts that have been part of previous versions of OLM and adds new capabilities.

:FeatureName: {olmv1}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

During this Technology Preview phase of {olmv1} in {product-title} 4.14, administrators can explore the following features:

Fully declarative model that supports GitOps workflows::
{olmv1} simplifies Operator management through two key APIs:
+
--
* A new `Operator` API, provided as `operator.operators.operatorframework.io` by the new Operator Controller component, streamlines management of installed Operators by consolidating user-facing APIs into a single object. This empowers administrators and SREs to automate processes and define desired states by using GitOps principles.
* The `Catalog` API, provided by the new catalogd component, serves as the foundation for {olmv1}, unpacking catalogs for on-cluster clients so that users can discover installable content, such as Operators and Kubernetes extensions. This provides increased visibility into all available Operator bundle versions, including their details, channels, and update edges.

Improved control over Operator updates::
With improved insight into catalog content, administrators can specify target versions for installation and updates. This grants administrators more control over the target version of Operator updates. For more information, see xref:../../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-updating-an-operator_olmv1-installing-operator[Updating an Operator].

Flexible Operator packaging format::
Administrators can use file-based catalogs to install and manage the following types of content:
+
--
* OLM-based Operators, similar to the existing OLM experience
* _Plain bundles_, which are static collections of arbitrary Kubernetes manifests
--
+
In addition, bundle size is no longer constrained by the etcd value size limit. For more information, see xref:../../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog.adoc#olmv1-installing-an-operator-from-a-catalog[Installing an Operator from a catalog] and xref:../../operators/olm_v1/olmv1-managing-plain-bundles.adoc#olmv1-managing-plain-bundles[Managing plain bundles].
