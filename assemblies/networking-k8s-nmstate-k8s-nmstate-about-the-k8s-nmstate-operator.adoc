toc::[]

The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across the {product-title} cluster's nodes with NMState. The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides users with functionality to configure various network interface types, DNS, and routing on cluster nodes. Additionally, the daemons on the cluster nodes periodically report on the state of each node's network interfaces to the API server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat supports the Kubernetes NMState Operator in production environments on bare-metal, {ibm-power-name}, {ibm-z-name}, {ibm-linuxone-name}, VMware vSphere, and OpenStack installations.
====

Before you can use NMState with {product-title}, you must install the Kubernetes NMState Operator.

[NOTE]
====
The Kubernetes NMState Operator updates the network configuration of a secondary NIC. It cannot update the network configuration of the primary NIC or the `br-ex` bridge.
====

{product-title} uses link:https://nmstate.github.io/[`nmstate`] to report on and configure the state of the node network. This makes it possible to modify the network policy configuration, such as by creating a Linux bridge on all nodes, by applying a single configuration manifest to the cluster.

Node networking is monitored and updated by the following objects:

`NodeNetworkState`:: Reports the state of the network on that node.
`NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy`:: Describes the requested network configuration on nodes. You update the node network configuration, including adding and removing interfaces, by applying a `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` manifest to the cluster.
`NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment`:: Reports the network policies enacted upon each node.
