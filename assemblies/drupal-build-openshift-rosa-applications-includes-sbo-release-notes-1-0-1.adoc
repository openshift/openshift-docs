== Fixed issues
* Before this update, binding the data values from a `Cluster` custom resource (CR) of the `postgresql.k8s.enterpriesedb.io/v1` API collected the `host` binding value from the `.metadata.name` field of the CR. The collected binding value is an incorrect hostname and the correct hostname is available at the `.status.writeService` field. With this update, the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to collect the `host` binding value from the `.status.writeService` field. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the correct hostname in the `host` and `provider` bindings. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1040[APPSVC-1040]
* Before this update, when you would bind a `PostgresCluster` CR of the `postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1` API, the binding data values did not include the values for the database certificates. As a result, the application failed to connect to the database. With this update, modifications to the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data from the backing service CR now include the database certificates. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the correct `ca.crt`, `tls.crt`, and `tls.key` certificate files. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1045[APPSVC-1045]
* Before this update, when you would bind a `PerconaXtraDBCluster` custom resource (CR) of the `pxc.percona.com` API, the binding data values did not include the `port` and `database` values. These binding values along with the others already projected are necessary for an application to successfully connect to the database service. With this update, the annotations that the {servicebinding-title} uses to expose the binding data values from the backing service CR are now modified to project the additional `port` and `database` binding values. The {servicebinding-title} uses these modified annotations to project the complete set of binding values that the application can use to successfully connect to the database service. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSVC-1073[APPSVC-1073]


[id="known-issues-1-0-1_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Currently, when you install the {servicebinding-title} in the single namespace installation mode, the absence of an appropriate namespace-scoped role-based access control (RBAC) rule prevents the successful binding of an application to a few known Operator-backed services that the {servicebinding-title} can automatically detect and bind to. In addition, the following error message is generated:
+
.Example error message
----
`postgresclusters.postgres-operator.crunchydata.com "hippo" is forbidden:
        User "system:serviceaccount:my-petclinic:service-binding-operator" cannot
        get resource "postgresclusters" in API group "postgres-operator.crunchydata.com"
        in the namespace "my-petclinic"`
----
+
Workaround 1: Install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode. As a result, the appropriate cluster-scoped RBAC rule now exists and the binding succeeds.
+
Workaround 2: If you cannot install the {servicebinding-title} in the `all namespaces` installation mode, install the following role binding into the namespace where the {servicebinding-title} is installed:
