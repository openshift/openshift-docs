toc::[]

To deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must create the following AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) resources:

* Specific account-wide IAM roles and policies that provide the STS permissions required for ROSA support, installation, control plane, and compute functionality. This includes account-wide Operator policies.
* Cluster-specific Operator IAM roles that permit the ROSA cluster Operators to carry out core OpenShift functionality.
* An OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that the cluster Operators use to authenticate.
* If you deploy ROSA by using {cluster-manager}, you must create the additional resources:
** An {cluster-manager} IAM role to complete the installation on your cluster.
** A user role without any permissions to verify your AWS account identity.

This document provides reference information about the IAM resources that you must deploy when you create a ROSA cluster that uses STS. It also includes the `aws` CLI commands that are generated when you use `manual` mode with the `rosa create` command.

== {cluster-manager} roles and permissions

If you create ROSA clusters by using {cluster-manager-url}, you must have the following AWS IAM roles linked to your AWS account to create and manage the clusters. For more information about linking your IAM roles to your AWS account, see xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#rosa-associating-account_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[Associating your AWS account].

[TIP]
====
If you only use the ROSA CLI (`rosa`), then you do not need to create these IAM roles.
====

These AWS IAM roles are as follows:

* The ROSA user role is an AWS role used by Red Hat to verify the customer's AWS identity. This role has no additional permissions, and the role has a trust relationship with the Red Hat installer account.
* An `ocm-role` resource grants the required permissions for installation of ROSA clusters in {cluster-manager}. You can apply basic or administrative permissions to the `ocm-role` resource. If you create an administrative `ocm-role` resource, {cluster-manager} can create the needed AWS Operator roles and OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. This IAM role also creates a trust relationship with the Red Hat installer account as well.

[NOTE]
====
The `ocm-role` IAM resource refers to the combination of the IAM role and the necessary policies created with it.
====

You must create this user role as well as an administrative `ocm-role` resource, if you want to use the auto mode in {cluster-manager} to create your Operator role policies and OIDC provider.

== Open ID Connect (OIDC) requirements for Operator authentication

For ROSA installations that use STS, you must create a cluster-specific OIDC provider that is used by the cluster Operators to authenticate or create your own OIDC configuration for your own OIDC provider.
