Kubernetes offers two features that users can use to enforce network security. One feature that allows users to enforce network policy is the `NetworkPolicy` API that is designed mainly for application developers and namespace tenants to protect their namespaces by creating namespace-scoped policies. For more information, see xref:../../networking/openshift_network_security/network_policy/about-network-policy.adoc#nw-networkpolicy-about_about-network-policy[About network policy].

The second feature is `AdminNetworkPolicy` which consists of two APIs: the `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) API and the `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) API. ANP and BANP are designed for cluster and network administrators to protect their entire cluster by creating cluster-scoped policies. Cluster administrators can use ANPs to enforce non-overridable policies that take precedence over `NetworkPolicy` objects. Administrators can use BANP to set up and enforce optional cluster-scoped network policy rules that are overridable by users using `NetworkPolicy` objects when necessary. When used together, ANP and BANP can create a multi-tenancy policy that administrators can use to secure their cluster.

OVN-Kubernetes CNI in {product-title} implements these network policies using Access Control List (ACL) Tiers to evaluate and apply them. ACLs are evaluated in descending order from Tier 1 to Tier 3.

Tier 1 evaluates `AdminNetworkPolicy` (ANP) objects. Tier 2 evaluates `NetworkPolicy` objects. Tier 3 evaluates `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) objects.

When traffic matches an ANP rule, the rules in that ANP are evaluated first. When the match is an ANP `allow` or `deny` rule, any existing `NetworkPolicy` and `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) objects in the cluster are skipped from evaluation. When the match is an ANP `pass` rule, then evaluation moves from tier 1 of the ACL to tier 2 where the `NetworkPolicy` policy is evaluated.
