The {servicebinding-title} consists of a controller and an accompanying custom resource definition (CRD) for service binding. It manages the data plane for workloads and backing services. The Service Binding Controller reads the data made available by the control plane of backing services. Then, it projects this data to workloads according to the rules specified through the `ServiceBinding` resource.

With {servicebinding-title}, you can:

* Bind your workloads together with Operator-managed backing services.
* Automate configuration of binding data.
* Provide service operators a low-touch administrative experience to provision and manage access to services.
* Enrich development lifecycle with a consistent and declarative service binding method that eliminates discrepancies in cluster environments.

The custom resource definition (CRD) of the {servicebinding-title} supports the following APIs:

* *Service Binding* with the `binding.operators.coreos.com` API group.
* *Service Binding (Spec API)* with the `servicebinding.io` API group.

== Making open source more inclusive

Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language[Red Hat CTO Chris Wright's message].
