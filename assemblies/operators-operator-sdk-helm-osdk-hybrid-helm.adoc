The standard Helm-based Operator support in the Operator SDK has limited functionality compared to the Go-based and Ansible-based Operator support that has reached the Auto Pilot capability (level V) in the xref:../../../operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.adoc#olm-maturity-model_olm-what-operators-are[Operator maturity model].

The Hybrid Helm Operator enhances the existing Helm-based support's abilities through Go APIs. With this hybrid approach of Helm and Go, the Operator SDK enables Operator authors to use the following process:

* Generate a default structure for, or _scaffold_, a Go API in the same project as Helm.
* Configure the Helm reconciler in the `main.go` file of the project, through the libraries provided by the Hybrid Helm Operator.

This tutorial walks through the following process using the Hybrid Helm Operator:

* Create a `Memcached` deployment through a Helm chart if it does not exist
* Ensure that the deployment size is the same as specified by `Memcached` custom resource (CR) spec
* Create a `MemcachedBackup` deployment by using the Go API
