= Example: VM node placement with tolerations

In this example, nodes that are reserved for virtual machines are already labeled with the `key=virtualization:NoSchedule` taint. Because this virtual machine has matching `tolerations`, it can schedule onto the tainted nodes.

[NOTE]
====
A virtual machine that tolerates a taint is not required to schedule onto a node with that taint.
