= Sample Helm chart

When a Helm Operator project is created, the Operator SDK creates a sample Helm chart that contains a set of templates for a simple Nginx release.

For this example, templates are available for deployment, service, and ingress resources, along with a `NOTES.txt` template, which Helm chart developers use to convey helpful information about a release.

If you are not already familiar with Helm charts, review the link:https://docs.helm.sh/developing_charts/[Helm developer documentation].
