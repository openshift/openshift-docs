Description::
+
--
Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is `cluster`. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc. Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource. 
 Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration. As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly. Instead, you should consume the NetworkStatus, as it indicates the currently deployed configuration. Currently, most spec fields are immutable after installation. Please view the individual ones for further details on each.

| `status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterNetwork`
| `array`
| IP address pool to use for pod IPs. This field is immutable after installation.

| `clusterNetwork[]`
| `object`
| ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.

| `externalIP`
| `object`
| externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

| `networkType`
| `string`

| `serviceNetwork`
| `array (string)`
| IP address pool for services. Currently, we only support a single entry here. This field is immutable after installation.

| `serviceNodePortRange`
| `string`
| The port range allowed for Services of type NodePort. If not specified, the default of 30000-32767 will be used. Such Services without a NodePort specified will have one automatically allocated from this range. This parameter can be updated after the cluster is installed.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string.

| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
