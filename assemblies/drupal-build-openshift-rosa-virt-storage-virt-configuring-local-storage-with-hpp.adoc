You can configure local storage for virtual machines by using the hostpath provisioner (HPP).

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner Operator is automatically installed. HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName} that is created by the Hostpath Provisioner Operator. To use HPP, you create an HPP custom resource (CR) with a basic storage pool.
