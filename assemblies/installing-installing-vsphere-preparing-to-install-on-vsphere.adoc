You can install an {product-title} cluster on vSphere using a variety of different installation methods.
Each method has qualities that can make them more suitable for different use cases, such as installing a cluster in a disconnected environment or installing a cluster with minimal configuration and provisioning.

== Assisted Installer

You can install {product-title} with the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer and is ideal for connected environments like vSphere. Installing with the {ai-full} also provides integration with vSphere, enabling autoscaling. See xref:../../installing/installing_on_prem_assisted/installing-on-prem-assisted.adoc#installing-on-prem-assisted[Installing an on-premise cluster using the {ai-full}] for additional details.

== Agent-based Installer

You can install an {product-title} cluster on vSphere using the Agent-based Installer.
The Agent-based Installer can be used to boot an on-premises server in a disconnected environment by using a bootable image.
With the Agent-based Installer, users also have the flexibility to provision infrastructure, customize network configurations, and customize installations within a disconnected environment.
See xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Preparing to install with the Agent-based Installer] for additional details.

== Installer-provisioned infrastructure installation

You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure.
Installer-provisioned infrastructure allows the installation program to preconfigure and automate the provisioning of resources required by {product-title}.
Installer-provisioned infrastructure is useful for installing in environments with disconnected networks, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned[Installing a cluster on vSphere]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with no customization.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using installer-provisioned infrastructure installation with the default customization options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations]**: You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned vSphere infrastructure, with network customizations. You can customize your {product-title} network configuration during installation, so that your cluster can coexist with your existing IP address allocations and adhere to your network requirements.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/ipi/installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-installer-provisioned-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network]**: You can install a cluster on VMware vSphere infrastructure in a restricted network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content.
 You can use this method to deploy {product-title} on an internal network that is not visible to the internet.

== User-provisioned infrastructure installation

You can install {product-title} on vSphere by using user-provisioned infrastructure.
User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.
If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-vsphere.adoc#installing-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-vsphere-network-customizations.adoc#installing-vsphere-network-customizations[Installing a cluster on vSphere with network customizations with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision with customized network configuration options.

* **xref:../../installing/installing_vsphere/upi/installing-restricted-networks-vsphere.adoc#installing-restricted-networks-vsphere[Installing a cluster on vSphere in a restricted network with user-provisioned infrastructure]**: {product-title} can be installed on VMware vSphere infrastructure that you provision in a restricted network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the vSphere platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
