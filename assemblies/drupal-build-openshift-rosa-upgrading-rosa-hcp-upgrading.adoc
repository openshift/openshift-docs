= Upgrading {hcp-title} clusters
:context: rosa-hcp-upgrading


You can upgrade {hcp-title-first} clusters by individually upgrading the hosted control plane and the machine pools with the ROSA command line interface (CLI), `rosa`.

Use one of the following methods to upgrade your HCP clusters:

* Upgrade only your hosted control plane. This does not impact your worker nodes.
* Upgrade only your machine pool. This initiates a rolling reboot of a specific machine pool and temporarily impacts the worker nodes on the specific machine pool. It does not impact all your worker nodes if you have multiple machine pools.
* Upgrade multiple machine pools simultaneously. This initiates a rolling reboot of worker nodes in the updated machine pools. This allows for updating multiple nodes simultaneously within a cluster.
* Upgrade your hosted control plane first and then your machine pool.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to upgrade both your hosted control plane and your machine pool to the same version, you must upgrade the hosted control plane first.
====

To plan an upgrade, review the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/introduction_to_rosa/#rosa-hcp-life-cycle[{hcp-title} update life cycle] documentation. The life cycle page includes release definitions, support and upgrade requirements, installation policy information, and life cycle dates.

[NOTE]
====
Hosted control plane upgrade duration varies based on your workload configuration, and machine pool upgrade duration varies based on the number of worker nodes.
