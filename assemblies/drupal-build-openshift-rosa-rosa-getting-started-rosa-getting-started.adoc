Follow this getting started document to create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster, grant user access, deploy your first application, and learn how to revoke user access and delete your cluster.

You can create a ROSA cluster either with or without the AWS Security Token Service (STS). The procedures in this document enable you to create a cluster that uses AWS STS. For more information about using AWS STS with ROSA clusters, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/introduction_to_rosa/#rosa-understanding-aws-sts_rosa-understanding[Using the AWS Security Token Service].

== Creating a ROSA cluster with STS

Choose from one of the following methods to deploy a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS). In each scenario, you can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`):

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/install_rosa_classic_clusters/#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[*Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using the default options*]: You can create a ROSA cluster with STS quickly by using the default options and automatic STS resource creation.

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/install_rosa_classic_clusters/#rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[*Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations*]: You can create a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations. You can also choose between the `auto` and `manual` modes when creating the required STS resources.
