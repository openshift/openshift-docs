QinQ, formally known as 802.1Q-in-802.1Q, is a networking technique defined by IEEE 802.1ad. IEEE 802.1ad extends the IEEE 802.1Q-1998 standard and enriches VLAN capabilities by introducing an additional 802.1Q tag to packets already tagged with 802.1Q. This method is also referred to as VLAN stacking or double VLAN.
