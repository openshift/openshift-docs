= Example: VM node placement with pod affinity and pod anti-affinity

In this example, the VM must be scheduled on a node that has a running pod with the label `example-key-1 = example-value-1`. If there is no such pod running on any node, the VM is not scheduled.

If possible, the VM is not scheduled on a node that has any pod with the label `example-key-2 = example-value-2`. However, if all candidate nodes have a pod with this label, the scheduler ignores this constraint.

<1> If you use the `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` rule type, the VM is not scheduled if the constraint is not met.
<2> If you use the `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` rule type, the VM is still scheduled if the constraint is not met, as long as all required constraints are met.
