:context: olm-cs-podsched


When an Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) catalog source of source type `grpc` defines a `spec.image`, the Catalog Operator creates a pod that serves the defined image content. By default, this pod defines the following in its specification:

* Only the `kubernetes.io/os=linux` node selector.
* The default priority class name: `system-cluster-critical`.
* No tolerations.

As an administrator, you can override these values by modifying fields in the `CatalogSource` object's optional `spec.grpcPodConfig` section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Marketplace Operator, `openshift-marketplace`, manages the default `OperatorHub` custom resource's (CR). This CR manages `CatalogSource` objects. If you attempt to modify fields in the `CatalogSource` objectâ€™s `spec.grpcPodConfig` section, the Marketplace Operator automatically reverts these modifications.By default, if you modify fields in the `spec.grpcPodConfig` section of the   `CatalogSource` object, the Marketplace Operator automatically reverts these changes.

To apply persistent changes to `CatalogSource` object, you must first disable a default `CatalogSource` object.
