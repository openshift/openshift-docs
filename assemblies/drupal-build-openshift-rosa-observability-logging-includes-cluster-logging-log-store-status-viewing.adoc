= Viewing the status of the Elasticsearch log store

You can view the status of the Elasticsearch log store.

.Prerequisites

* The {clo} and {es-op} are installed.

.Procedure

. Change to the `openshift-logging` project by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc project openshift-logging
----

. To view the status:

.. Get the name of the Elasticsearch log store instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME            AGE
elasticsearch   5h9m
----

.. Get the Elasticsearch log store status by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch <Elasticsearch-instance> -o yaml
----
+
For example:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get Elasticsearch elasticsearch -n openshift-logging -o yaml
----
+
The output includes information similar to the following:
+

<1> In the output, the cluster status fields appear in the `status` stanza.
<2> The status of the Elasticsearch log store:
+
* The number of active primary shards.
* The number of active shards.
* The number of shards that are initializing.
* The number of Elasticsearch log store data nodes.
* The total number of Elasticsearch log store nodes.
* The number of pending tasks.
* The Elasticsearch log store status: `green`, `red`, `yellow`.
* The number of unassigned shards.
<3> Any status conditions, if present. The Elasticsearch log store status indicates the reasons from the scheduler if a pod could not be placed. Any events related to the following conditions are shown:
* Container Waiting for both the Elasticsearch log store and proxy containers.
* Container Terminated for both the Elasticsearch log store and proxy containers.
* Pod unschedulable.
Also, a condition is shown for a number of issues; see *Example condition messages*.
<4> The Elasticsearch log store nodes in the cluster, with `upgradeStatus`.
<5> The Elasticsearch log store client, data, and master pods in the cluster, listed under `failed`, `notReady`, or `ready` state.

== Example condition messages

The following are examples of some condition messages from the `Status` section of the Elasticsearch instance.

The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured low watermark, and no shard will be allocated to this node.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T15:57:22Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be not
        be allocated on this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark Low
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
----

The following status message indicates that a node has exceeded the configured high watermark, and shards will be relocated to other nodes.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  nodes:
  - conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 2019-03-15T16:04:45Z
      message: Disk storage usage for node is 27.5gb (36.74%). Shards will be relocated
        from this node.
      reason: Disk Watermark High
      status: "True"
      type: NodeStorage
    deploymentName: example-elasticsearch-cdm-0-1
    upgradeStatus: {}
----

The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store node selector in the custom resource (CR) does not match any nodes in the cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
    nodes:
    - conditions:
      - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-10T02:26:24Z
        message: '0/8 nodes are available: 8 node(s) didn''t match node selector.'
        reason: Unschedulable
        status: "True"
        type: Unschedulable
----

The following status message indicates that the Elasticsearch log store CR uses a non-existent persistent volume claim (PVC).

[source,yaml]
----
status:
   nodes:
   - conditions:
     - last Transition Time:  2019-04-10T05:55:51Z
       message:               pod has unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims (repeated 5 times)
       reason:                Unschedulable
       status:                True
       type:                  Unschedulable
----

The following status message indicates that your Elasticsearch log store cluster does not have enough nodes to support the redundancy policy.

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  clusterHealth: ""
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: 2019-04-17T20:01:31Z
    message: Wrong RedundancyPolicy selected. Choose different RedundancyPolicy or
      add more nodes with data roles
    reason: Invalid Settings
    status: "True"
    type: InvalidRedundancy
----

This status message indicates your cluster has too many control plane nodes:

[source,yaml]
----
status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: '2019-04-17T20:12:34Z'
      message: >-
        Invalid master nodes count. Please ensure there are no more than 3 total
        nodes with master roles
      reason: Invalid Settings
      status: 'True'
      type: InvalidMasters
----


The following status message indicates that Elasticsearch storage does not support the change you tried to make.

For example:
[source,yaml]
----
status:
  clusterHealth: green
  conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: "2021-05-07T01:05:13Z"
      message: Changing the storage structure for a custom resource is not supported
      reason: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
      status: 'True'
      type: StorageStructureChangeIgnored
----

The `reason` and `type` fields specify the type of unsupported change:

`StorageClassNameChangeIgnored`:: Unsupported change to the storage class name.
`StorageSizeChangeIgnored`:: Unsupported change the storage size.
`StorageStructureChangeIgnored`:: Unsupported change between ephemeral and persistent storage structures.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you try to configure the `ClusterLogging` CR to switch from ephemeral to persistent storage, the {es-op} creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) but does not create a persistent volume (PV). To clear the `StorageStructureChangeIgnored` status, you must revert the change to the `ClusterLogging` CR and delete the PVC.
