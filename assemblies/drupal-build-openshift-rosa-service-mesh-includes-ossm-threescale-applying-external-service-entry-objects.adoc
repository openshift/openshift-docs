= Applying 3scale external ServiceEntry objects

To have the `threescale-wasm-auth` module authorize requests against 3scale, the module must have access to 3scale services. You can do this within {SMProductName} by applying an external `ServiceEntry` object and a corresponding `DestinationRule` object for TLS configuration to use the HTTPS protocol.

The custom resources (CRs) set up the service entries and destination rules for secure access from within {SMProductShortName} to 3scale Hosted (SaaS) for the backend and system components of the Service Management API and the Account Management API. The Service Management API receives queries for the authorization status of each request. The Account Management API provides API management configuration settings for your services.

.Procedure

. Apply the following external `ServiceEntry` CR and related `DestinationRule` CR for 3scale Hosted *backend* to your cluster:
.. Add the `ServiceEntry` CR to a file called `service-entry-threescale-saas-backend.yml`:
+
.ServiceEntry CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: service-entry-threescale-saas-backend
spec:
  hosts:
  - su1.3scale.net
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
----
.. Add the `DestinationRule` CR to a file called `destination-rule-threescale-saas-backend.yml`:
+
.DestinationRule CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: destination-rule-threescale-saas-backend
spec:
  host: su1.3scale.net
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      sni: su1.3scale.net
----

.. Apply and save the external `ServiceEntry` CR for the 3scale Hosted backend to your cluster, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f service-entry-threescale-saas-backend.yml
----

.. Apply and save the external `DestinationRule` CR for the 3scale Hosted backend to your cluster, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f destination-rule-threescale-saas-backend.yml
----

. Apply the following external `ServiceEntry` CR and related `DestinationRule` CR for 3scale Hosted *system* to your cluster:
.. Add the `ServiceEntry` CR to a file called `service-entry-threescale-saas-system.yml`:
+
.ServiceEntry CR
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: service-entry-threescale-saas-system
spec:
  hosts:
  - multitenant.3scale.net
  ports:
  - number: 443
    name: https
    protocol: HTTPS
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  resolution: DNS
----
.. Add the `DestinationRule` CR to a file called `destination-rule-threescale-saas-system.yml`:
+
.DestinationRule CR
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: destination-rule-threescale-saas-system
spec:
  host: multitenant.3scale.net
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      sni: multitenant.3scale.net
----

.. Apply and save the external `ServiceEntry` CR for the 3scale Hosted system to your cluster, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f service-entry-threescale-saas-system.yml
----

.. Apply and save the external `DestinationRule` CR for the 3scale Hosted system to your cluster, by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <destination-rule-threescale-saas-system.yml>
----

Alternatively, you can deploy an in-mesh 3scale service. To deploy an in-mesh 3scale service, change the location of the services in the CR by deploying 3scale and linking to the deployment.
