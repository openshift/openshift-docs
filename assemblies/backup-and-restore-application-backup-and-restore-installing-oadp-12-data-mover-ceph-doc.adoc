= Using OADP 1.2 Data Mover with Ceph storage
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: backing-up-applications

toc::[]

You can use OADP 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore application data for clusters that use CephFS, CephRBD, or both.

OADP 1.2 Data Mover leverages Ceph features that support large-scale environments. One of these is the shallow copy method, which is available for {product-title} 4.12 and later. This feature supports backing up and restoring `StorageClass` and `AccessMode` resources other than what is found on the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CephFS shallow copy feature is a backup feature. It is not part of restore operations.

[id="defining-crs-for-12-data-mover"]
== Defining custom resources for use with OADP 1.2 Data Mover

When you install {rh-storage-first}, it automatically creates default CephFS and a CephRBD `StorageClass` and `VolumeSnapshotClass` custom resources (CRs). You must define these CRs for use with OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover.

After you define the CRs, you must make several other changes to your environment before you can perform your back up and restore operations.

== Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and CephFS storage

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to back up and restore data using CephFS storage by enabling the shallow copy feature of CephFS.

== Backing up and restoring data using OADP 1.2 Data Mover and split volumes (CephFS and Ceph RBD)

You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore data in an environment that has _split volumes_, that is, an environment that uses both CephFS and CephRBD.
