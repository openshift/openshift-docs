include::../includes/rosa-sts.adoc[]

[id="prerequisites_rosa-deleting-cluster"]
== Prerequisites

* If {product-title} created a VPC, you must remove the following items from your cluster before you can successfully delete your cluster:
** Network configurations, such as VPN configurations and VPC peering connections
** Any additional services that were added to the VPC

If these configurations and services remain, the cluster does not delete properly.

include::../includes/rosa-deleting-cluster.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
.Troubleshooting
* If the cluster cannot be deleted because of missing IAM roles, see Additional link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/support/#rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deletion_rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deployments[Repairing a cluster that cannot be deleted].
* If the cluster cannot be deleted for other reasons:
** Check that there are no Add-ons for your cluster pending in the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console].
** Check that all AWS resources and dependencies have been deleted in the Amazon Web Console.
