= Cluster self-service

Customers can self-service their clusters, including, but not limited to:

* Create a cluster
* Delete a cluster
* Add or remove an identity provider
* Add or remove a user from an elevated group
* Configure cluster privacy
* Add or remove machine pools and configure autoscaling
* Define upgrade policies

You can perform these self-service tasks using the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`.
