You can initiate the live migration of a virtual machine (VM) to another node by using the xref:virt-initiating-vm-migration-web_virt-initiating-live-migration[{product-title} web console] or the xref:virt-initiating-vm-migration-cli_virt-initiating-live-migration[command line].

You can cancel a live migration by using the xref:virt-canceling-vm-migration-web_virt-initiating-live-migration[web console] or the xref:virt-canceling-vm-migration-cli_virt-initiating-live-migration[command line]. The VM remains on its original node.

[TIP]
====
You can also initiate and cancel live migration by using the `virtctl migrate <vm_name>` and `virtctl migrate-cancel <vm_name>` commands.
