{product-title} Security Profiles Operator (SPO) provides a way to define secure computing (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/[seccomp]) profiles and SELinux profiles as custom resources, synchronizing profiles to every node in a given namespace. For the latest updates, see the xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-release-notes.adoc#spo-release-notes[release notes].

The SPO can distribute custom resources to each node while a reconciliation loop ensures that the profiles stay up-to-date. See xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-understanding.adoc#spo-understanding[Understanding the Security Profiles Operator].

The SPO manages SELinux policies and seccomp profiles for namespaced workloads. For more information, see xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-enabling.adoc#spo-enabling[Enabling the Security Profiles Operator].

You can create xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-seccomp.adoc#spo-seccomp[seccomp] and xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-selinux.adoc#spo-selinux[SELinux] profiles, bind policies to pods, record workloads, and synchronize all worker nodes in a namespace.

Use xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-advanced.adoc#spo-advanced[Advanced Security Profile Operator tasks] to enable the log enricher, configure webhooks and metrics, or restrict profiles to a single namespace.

You can xref:../../security/security_profiles_operator/spo-uninstalling.adoc#spo-uninstalling[Uninstall the Security Profiles Operator] by removing the profiles before removing the Operator.
