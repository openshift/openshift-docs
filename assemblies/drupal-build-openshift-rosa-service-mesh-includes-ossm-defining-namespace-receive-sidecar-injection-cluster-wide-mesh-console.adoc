= Defining which namespaces receive sidecar injection in a cluster-wide mesh by using the web console

By default, the {SMProductName} Operator uses member selectors to identify which namespaces receive sidecar injection. Namespaces that do not match the `istio-injection=enabled` label as defined in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource do not receive sidecar injection.

[NOTE]
====
Using discovery selectors to determine which namespaces the mesh can discover has no effect on sidecar injection. Discovering namespaces and configuring sidecar injection are separate operations.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* You have deployed a `ServiceMeshControlPlanae` resource with the `mode: ClusterWide` annotation.
* You are logged in as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. If you use {product-dedicated}, you are logged in as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console.

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll*.

. Click the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.

. Click *YAML*.

. Modify the `spec.memberSelectors` field in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource by adding a member selector that matches the `inject` label. The following example uses `istio-injection: enabled`:

      istio-injection: enabled <1>
----
<1> Ensures that the namespace receives sidecar injection. 

. Save the file.
