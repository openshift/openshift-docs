include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

You can remove the custom metrics autoscaler from your {product-title} cluster. After removing the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator, remove other components associated with the Operator to avoid potential issues.

[NOTE]
====
Delete the `KedaController` custom resource (CR) first. If you do not delete the `KedaController` CR, {product-title} can hang when you delete the `openshift-keda` project. If you delete the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator before deleting the CR, you are not able to delete the CR.
