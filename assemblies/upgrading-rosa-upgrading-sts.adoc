== Upgrading a ROSA Classic cluster

There are two methods to upgrade Classic {product-title} (ROSA) clusters:

* Individual upgrades through the ROSA CLI (`rosa`)
* Individual upgrades through the {cluster-manager} console

[NOTE]
====
When you follow a scheduled upgrade policy, a delay of an hour or more before the upgrade process begins might occur, even if the upgrade is configured to begin immediately. Additionally, the duration of the upgrade might vary based on your workload configuration.
