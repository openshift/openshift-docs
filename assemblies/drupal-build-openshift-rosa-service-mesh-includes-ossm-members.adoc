= Creating the {SMProductName} members

`ServiceMeshMember` resources provide a way for {SMProductName} administrators to delegate permissions to add projects to a service mesh, even when the respective users do not have direct access to the service mesh project or member roll. While project administrators are automatically given permission to create the `ServiceMeshMember` resource in their project, they cannot point it to any `ServiceMeshControlPlane` until the service mesh administrator explicitly grants access to the service mesh. Administrators can grant users permissions to access the mesh by granting them the `mesh-user` user role. In this example, `istio-system` is the name of the {SMProductShortName} control plane project.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user -n istio-system --role-namespace istio-system mesh-user <user_name>
----

Administrators can modify the `mesh-user` role binding in the {SMProductShortName} control plane project to specify the users and groups that are granted access. The `ServiceMeshMember` adds the project to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` within the {SMProductShortName} control plane project that it references.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMember
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  controlPlaneRef:
    namespace: istio-system
    name: basic
----

The `mesh-users` role binding is created automatically after the administrator creates the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. An administrator can use the following command to add a role to a user.

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user
----

The administrator can also create the `mesh-user` role binding before the administrator creates the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource. For example, the administrator can create it in the same `oc apply` operation as the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource.

This example adds a role binding for `alice`:
