:context: threescale-adapter


The 3scale Istio Adapter is an optional adapter that allows you to label a service running within the {SMProductName} and integrate that service with the 3scale API Management solution.
It is not required for {SMProductName}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only use the 3scale Istio adapter with {SMProductName} versions 2.0 and below. The Mixer component was deprecated in release 2.0 and removed in release 2.1. For {SMProductName} versions 2.1.0 and later you should use the xref:ossm-threescale-webassembly-module[3scale WebAssembly module].

If you want to enable 3scale backend cache with the 3scale Istio adapter, you must also enable Mixer policy and Mixer telemetry. See xref:ossm-create-smcp[Deploying the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh control plane].
