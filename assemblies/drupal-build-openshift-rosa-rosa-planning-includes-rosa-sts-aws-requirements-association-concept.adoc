= AWS account association

{product-title} (ROSA) cluster-provisioning tasks require linking `ocm-role` and `user-role` IAM roles to your AWS account using your Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

The `ocm-role` ARN is stored as a label in your Red Hat organization while the `user-role` ARN is stored as a label inside your Red Hat user account. Red Hat uses these ARN labels to confirm that the user is a valid account holder and that the correct permissions are available to perform the necessary tasks in the AWS account.
