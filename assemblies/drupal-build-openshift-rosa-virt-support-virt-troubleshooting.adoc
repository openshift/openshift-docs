{VirtProductName} provides tools and logs for troubleshooting virtual machines (VMs) and virtualization components.


You can troubleshoot {VirtProductName} components by using the xref:virt-web-console_virt-support-overview[tools provided in the web console] or by using the `oc` CLI tool.

// This section is in an assembly so that we can use xrefs.

link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/nodes/#nodes-containers-events[{product-title} events] are records of important life-cycle information and are useful for monitoring and troubleshooting virtual machine, namespace, and resource issues.

* VM events: Navigate to the xref:virtualmachine-details-events_virt-web-console-overview[*Events* tab] of the *VirtualMachine details* page in the web console.

[id="guest-system-logs_{context}"]
== Guest system logs

Viewing the boot logs of VM guests can help diagnose issues. You can configure access to guests' logs and view them by using either the {product-title} web console or the `oc` CLI. 

This feature is disabled by default. If a VM does not explicitly have this setting enabled or disabled, it inherits the cluster-wide default setting.

====
If sensitive information such as credentials or other personally identifiable information (PII) is written to the serial console, it is logged with all other visible text. Red Hat recommends using SSH to send sensitive data instead of the serial console.
