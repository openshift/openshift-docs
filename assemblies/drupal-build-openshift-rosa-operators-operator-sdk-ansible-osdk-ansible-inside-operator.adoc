= Using Ansible inside an Operator
include::../../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: osdk-ansible-inside-operator


After you are familiar with xref:osdk-ansible-k8s-collection[using the Kubernetes Collection for Ansible locally], you can trigger the same Ansible logic inside of an Operator when a custom resource (CR) changes. This example maps an Ansible role to a specific Kubernetes resource that the Operator watches. This mapping is done in the `watches.yaml` file.
