= Automatically generated secrets

By default, {product-title} creates the following secrets for each service account:

* A dockercfg image pull secret
* A service account token secret
+
[NOTE]
====
Prior to {product-title} 4.11, a second service account token secret was generated when a service account was created. This service account token secret was used to access the Kubernetes API.

Starting with {product-title} 4.11, this second service account token secret is no longer created. This is because the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` upstream Kubernetes feature gate was enabled, which stops the automatic generation of secret-based service account tokens to access the Kubernetes API.

After upgrading to {product-version}, any existing service account token secrets are not deleted and continue to function.
====

This service account token secret and docker configuration image pull secret are necessary to integrate the {product-registry} into the cluster's user authentication and authorization system.

However, if you do not enable the `ImageRegistry` capability or if you disable the integrated {product-registry} in the Cluster Image Registry Operator's configuration, these secrets are not generated for each service account.

[WARNING]
====
Do not rely on these automatically generated secrets for your own use; they might be removed in a future {product-title} release.
====

Workloads are automatically injected with a projected volume to obtain a bound service account token. If your workload needs an additional service account token, add an additional projected volume in your workload manifest. Bound service account tokens are more secure than service account token secrets for the following reasons:

* Bound service account tokens have a bounded lifetime.
* Bound service account tokens contain audiences.
* Bound service account tokens can be bound to pods or secrets and the bound tokens are invalidated when the bound object is removed.

For more information, see _Configuring bound service account tokens using volume projection_.

You can also manually create a service account token secret to obtain a token, if the security exposure of a non-expiring token in a readable API object is acceptable to you. For more information, see _Creating a service account token secret_.
