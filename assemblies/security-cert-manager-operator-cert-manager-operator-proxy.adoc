:context: cert-manager-operator-proxy

If a cluster-wide egress proxy is configured in {product-title}, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically configures Operators that it manages with the cluster-wide proxy. OLM automatically updates all of the Operator's deployments with the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

You can inject any CA certificates that are required for proxying HTTPS connections into the {cert-manager-operator}.
