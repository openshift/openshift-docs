= Least privilege permissions for ROSA CLI commands
:context: rosa-cli-permission-examples
toc::[]

You can create roles with permissions that adhere to the principal of least privilege, in which the users assigned the roles have no other permissions assigned to them outside the scope of the specific action they need to perform. These policies contain only the minimum required permissions needed to perform specific actions by using the {product-title} (ROSA) command line interface (CLI).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although the policies and commands presented in this topic will work in conjunction with one another, you might have other restrictions within your AWS environment that make the policies for these commands insufficient for your specific needs. Red{nbsp}Hat provides these examples as a baseline, assuming no other AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) restrictions are present.

[NOTE]
====
The examples listed cover several of the most common ROSA CLI commands. For more information regarding ROSA CLI commands, see xref:../../cli_reference/rosa_cli/rosa-manage-objects-cli.adoc#rosa-common-commands_rosa-managing-objects-cli[Common commands and arguments].
