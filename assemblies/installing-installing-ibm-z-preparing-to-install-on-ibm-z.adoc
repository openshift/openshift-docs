== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* Before you begin the installation process, you must clean the installation directory. This ensures that the required installation files are created and updated during the installation process.
* You provisioned xref:../../storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-ocs.adoc#persistent-storage-ocs[persistent storage using {rh-storage}] or other supported storage protocols for your cluster. To deploy a private image registry, you must set up persistent storage with `ReadWriteMany` access.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster requires access to.

While this document refers only to {ibm-z-name}, all information in it also applies to {ibm-linuxone-name}.

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on {ibm-z-title} or {ibm-linuxone-title}

The {product-title} installation program offers the following methods for deploying a cluster on {ibm-z-name}:

* *Interactive*: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/assisted_installer_for_openshift_container_platform[{ai-full}]. This method requires no setup for the installer, and is ideal for connected environments like {ibm-z-name}.

* *Local Agent-based*: You can deploy a cluster locally with the xref:../../installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.adoc#preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer[Agent-based Installer]. It provides many of the benefits of the {ai-full}, but you must download and configure the Agent-based Installer first. Configuration is done with a command line interface (CLI). This approach is ideal for disconnected networks.
// Tile on the console not available yet. once available add: the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/ibmz/agent-based[Agent-based Installer]

* *Full control*: You can deploy a cluster on xref:../../installing/installing_ibm_z/installing-ibm-z.adoc#installing-ibm-z[infrastructure that you prepare and maintain], which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.

=== User-provisioned infrastructure installation of {product-title} on {ibm-z-title}

User-provisioned infrastructure requires the user to provision all resources required by {product-title}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing a user-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided as an example only. Installing a cluster with infrastructure you provide requires knowledge of the {ibm-z-name} platform and the installation process of {product-title}. Use the user-provisioned infrastructure installation instructions as a guide; you are free to create the required resources through other methods.
