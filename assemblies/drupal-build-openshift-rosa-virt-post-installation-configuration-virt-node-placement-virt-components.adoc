:context: virt-node-placement-virt-components


The default scheduling for virtual machines (VMs) on bare metal nodes is appropriate. Optionally, you can specify the nodes where you want to deploy {VirtProductName} Operators, workloads, and controllers by configuring node placement rules.

[NOTE]
====
You can configure node placement rules for some components after installing {VirtProductName}, but virtual machines cannot be present if you want to configure node placement rules for workloads.
