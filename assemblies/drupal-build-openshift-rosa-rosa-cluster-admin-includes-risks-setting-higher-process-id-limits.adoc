= Risks of setting higher process ID limits for {product-title} pods

The `podPidsLimit` parameter for a pod controls the maximum number of processes and threads that can run simultaneously in that pod.

You can increase the value for `podPidsLimit` from the default of 4,096 to a maximum of 16,384. Changing this value might incur downtime for applications, because changing the `podPidsLimit` requires rebooting the affected node.

If you are running a large number of pods per node, and you have a high `podPidsLimit` value on your nodes, you risk exceeding the PID maximum for the node.

To find the maximum number of pods that you can run simultaneously on a single node without exceeding the PID maximum for the node, divide 3,650,000 by your `podPidsLimit` value. For example, if your `podPidsLimit` value is 16,384, and you expect the pods to use close to that number of process IDs, you can safely run 222 pods on a single node.

[NOTE]
====
Memory, CPU, and available storage can also limit the maximum number of pods that can run simultaneously, even when the `podPidsLimit` value is set appropriately. For more information, see "Planning your environment" and "Limits and scalability".
