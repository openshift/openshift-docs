Applying autoscaling to {product-title} clusters involves configuring a cluster autoscaler and then configuring a machine autoscaler for at least one machine pool in your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can configure the cluster autoscaler only in clusters where the machine API is operational.

Only one cluster autoscaler can be created per cluster.
