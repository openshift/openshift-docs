== Additional resources

{SMProductName} supports multiple independent control planes within the cluster. You can create reusable configurations with `ServiceMeshControlPlane` profiles. For more information, see xref:ossm-control-plane-profiles_ossm-profiles-users[Creating control plane profiles].

== Next steps

* Add a project to the {SMProductShortName} so that applications can be made available. For more information, see xref:ossm-create-mesh[Adding services to a service mesh].
