You can create a snapshot of a virtual machine (VM) by using the {product-title} web console.

The VM snapshot includes disks that meet the following requirements:

* Either a data volume or a persistent volume claim
* Belong to a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Virtualization* -> *VirtualMachines* in the web console.
. Select a VM to open the *VirtualMachine details* page.
. If the VM is running, click the options menu {kebab} and select *Stop* to power it down.
. Click the *Snapshots* tab and then click *Take Snapshot*.
. Enter the snapshot name.
. Expand *Disks included in this Snapshot* to see the storage volumes to be included in the snapshot.
. If your VM has disks that cannot be included in the snapshot and you wish to proceed, select *I am aware of this warning and wish to proceed*.
. Click *Save*.
