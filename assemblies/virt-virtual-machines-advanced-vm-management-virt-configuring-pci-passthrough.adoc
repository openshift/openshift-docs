//This assembly contains the content for
//configuring PCI passthrough by using the CLI. There are
//plans to enable PCI passthrough configuration
//by using the web console (next release).
//When this feature is available in the web console, please
//add the new content to this assembly.

The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) passthrough feature enables you to access and manage hardware devices from a virtual machine (VM). When PCI passthrough is configured, the PCI devices function as if they were physically attached to the guest operating system.

Cluster administrators can expose and manage host devices that are permitted to be used in the cluster by using the `oc` command-line interface (CLI).

You can prevent GPU operands from deploying on worker nodes that you designated for GPU passthrough.

== Configuring virtual machines for PCI passthrough

After the PCI devices have been added to the cluster, you can assign them to virtual machines. The PCI devices are now available as if they are physically connected to the virtual machines.
