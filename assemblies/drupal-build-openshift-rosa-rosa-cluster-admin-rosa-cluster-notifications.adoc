== What to expect from cluster notifications

As a cluster administrator, you need to be aware of when and why cluster notifications are sent, as well as their types and severity levels, in order to effectively understand the health and administration needs of your cluster.

== Cluster notification emails

By default, when a cluster notification is sent to the cluster, it is also sent as an email to the cluster owner. You can configure additional recipients for notification emails to ensure that all appropriate users remain informed about the state of the cluster.

//TODO OSDOCS-8938: This doesn't actually work as intended as far as Laura can tell; OpenShift users can't unsubscribe from all types using this method - need to check in with Abhishek about this.

* Ask the cluster owner or administrator to add you as a notification contact: xref:cluster-notification-emails_rosa-cluster-notifications[Cluster notification emails].
