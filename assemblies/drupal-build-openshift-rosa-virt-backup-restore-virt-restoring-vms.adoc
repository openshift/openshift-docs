You restore an OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) `Backup` custom resource (CR) by creating a xref:oadp-creating-restore-cr_virt-restoring-vms[`Restore` CR].

You can add xref:oadp-creating-restore-hooks_virt-restoring-vms[hooks] to the `Restore` CR to run commands in init containers, before the application container starts, or in the application container itself.
