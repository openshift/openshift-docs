= Monitoring application health using the Developer perspective

You can use the *Developer* perspective to add three types of health probes to your container to ensure that your application is healthy:

* Use the Readiness probe to check if the container is ready to handle requests.
* Use the Liveness probe to check if the container is running.
* Use the Startup probe to check if the application within the container has started.

You can add health checks either while creating and deploying an application, or after you have deployed an application.
