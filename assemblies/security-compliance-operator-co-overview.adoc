The {product-title} Compliance Operator assists users by automating the
inspection of numerous technical implementations and compares those against
certain aspects of industry standards, benchmarks, and baselines; the
Compliance Operator is not an auditor. In order to be compliant or certified
under these various standards, you need to engage an authorized auditor such as
a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA), Joint Authorization Board (JAB), or other
industry recognized regulatory authority to assess your environment.

The Compliance Operator makes recommendations based on generally available
information and practices regarding such standards and may assist with
remediations, but actual compliance is your responsibility. You are required to
work with an authorized auditor to achieve compliance with a standard. For the
latest updates, see the
