== Creating manifests by using the virtctl tool

You can use the `virtctl` CLI utility to simplify creating manifests for VMs, VM instance types, and VM preferences. For more information, see xref:vm-manifest-creation-commands_virt-using-the-cli-tools[VM manifest creation commands].

If you have a `VirtualMachine` manifest, you can create a VM from the xref:virt-creating-vms-from-cli[command line].
