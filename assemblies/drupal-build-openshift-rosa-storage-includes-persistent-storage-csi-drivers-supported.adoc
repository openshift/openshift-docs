[id="csi-drivers-supported_{context}"]
= CSI drivers supported by {product-title}

{product-title} installs certain CSI drivers by default, giving users storage options that are not possible with in-tree volume plugins.

To create CSI-provisioned persistent volumes that mount to these supported storage assets, {product-title} installs the necessary CSI driver Operator, the CSI driver, and the required storage class by default. For more details about the default namespace of the Operator and driver, see the documentation for the specific CSI Driver Operator.

====
The AWS EFS and GCP Filestore CSI drivers are not installed by default, and must be installed manually. For instructions on installing the AWS EFS CSI driver, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_dedicated/4/html/storage/using-container-storage-interface-csi#osd-persistent-storage-aws-efs-csi[Setting up AWS Elastic File Service CSI Driver Operator]. For instructions on installing the GCP Filestore CSI driver, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.13/html/storage/using-container-storage-interface-csi#persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file-overview[Google Compute Platform Filestore CSI Driver Operator].

In addition to the drivers listed in the preceding table, ROSA functions with CSI drivers from third-party storage vendors. Red Hat does not oversee third-party provisioners or the connected CSI drivers and the vendors fully control source code, deployment, operation, and Kubernetes compatibility. These volume provisioners are considered customer-managed and the respective vendors are responsible for providing support. See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_architecture/rosa_policy_service_definition/rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix.html#rosa-policy-responsibilities_rosa-policy-responsibility-matrix[Shared responsibilities for {product-title}] matrix for more information.
