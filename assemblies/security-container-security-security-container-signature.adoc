Red Hat delivers signatures for the images in the Red Hat Container Registries. Those signatures can be automatically verified when being pulled to {product-title} 4 clusters by using the Machine Config Operator (MCO).

link:https://quay.io/[Quay.io] serves most of the images that make up {product-title}, and only the release image is signed. Release images refer to the approved {product-title} images, offering a degree of protection against supply chain attacks. However, some extensions to {product-title}, such as logging, monitoring, and service mesh, are shipped as Operators from the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). Those images ship from the link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/explore[Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog Container images] registry.

To verify the integrity of those images between Red Hat registries and your infrastructure, enable signature verification.
