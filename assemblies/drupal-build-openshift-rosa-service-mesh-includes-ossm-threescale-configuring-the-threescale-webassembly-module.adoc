= Configuring the 3scale WebAssembly module

The architecture of the 3scale WebAssembly module configuration depends on the 3scale account and authorization service, and the list of services to handle.

.Prerequisites

The prerequisites are a set of minimum mandatory fields in all cases:

* For the 3scale account and authorization service: the `backend-listener` URL.
* For the list of services to handle: the service IDs and at least one credential look up method and where to find it.
* You will find examples for dealing with `userkey`, `appid` with `appkey`, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) patterns.
* The WebAssembly module uses the settings you specified in the static configuration. For example, if you add a mapping rule configuration to the module, it will always apply, even when the 3scale Admin Portal has no such mapping rule. The rest of the `WasmPlugin` resource exists around the `spec.pluginConfig` YAML entry.
