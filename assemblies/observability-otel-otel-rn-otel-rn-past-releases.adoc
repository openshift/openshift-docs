=== New features and enhancements

This update introduces the following enhancements:

* {OTELName} 3.0 is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] release 0.89.0.
* The *OpenShift distributed tracing data collection Operator* is renamed as the *{OTELOperator}*.
* Support for the ARM architecture.
* Support for the Prometheus receiver for metrics collection.
* Support for the Kafka receiver and exporter for sending traces and metrics to Kafka.
* Support for cluster-wide proxy environments.
* The {OTELOperator} creates the Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` custom resource if the Prometheus exporter is enabled.
* The Operator enables the `Instrumentation` custom resource that allows injecting upstream OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation libraries.

[id="otel-rn_3-0_removal-notice"]
=== Removal notice

In {OTELName} 3.0, the Jaeger exporter has been removed. Bug fixes and support are provided only through the end of the 2.9 lifecycle. As an alternative to the Jaeger exporter for sending data to the Jaeger collector, you can use the OTLP exporter instead.

[id="otel-rn_3-0_bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

This update introduces the following bug fixes:

* Fixed support for disconnected environments when using the `oc adm catalog mirror` CLI command.

[id="otel-rn_3-0_known-issues"]
=== Known issues

There is currently a known issue:
//There are currently known issues:

* Curently, the cluster monitoring of the {OTELOperator} is disabled due to a bug (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3761[TRACING-3761]). The bug is preventing the cluster monitoring from scraping metrics from the {OTELOperator} due to a missing label `openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true` that is required for the cluster monitoring and service monitor object.
+
.Workaround
+
You can enable the cluster monitoring as follows:
+
. Add the following label in the Operator namespace: `oc label namespace openshift-opentelemetry-operator openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true`
+
. Create a service monitor, role, and role binding:

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

{OTELName} 2.0 is based on the open source link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] release 0.33.0.

This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {OTELName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
