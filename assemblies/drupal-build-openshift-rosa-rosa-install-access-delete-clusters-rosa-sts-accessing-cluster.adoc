= Accessing a ROSA cluster
:context: rosa-sts-accessing-cluster


It is recommended that you access your {product-title} (ROSA) cluster using an identity provider (IDP) account. However, the cluster administrator who created the cluster can access it using the quick access procedure.

This document describes how to access a cluster and set up an IDP using the ROSA CLI (`rosa`). Alternatively, you can create an IDP account using {cluster-manager} console.
