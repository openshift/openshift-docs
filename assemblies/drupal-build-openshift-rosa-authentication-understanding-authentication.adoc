For users to interact with {product-title}, they must first authenticate
to the cluster. The authentication layer identifies the user associated with requests to the
{product-title} API. The authorization layer then uses information about the
requesting user to determine if the request is allowed.

As an administrator, you can configure authentication for {product-title}.
