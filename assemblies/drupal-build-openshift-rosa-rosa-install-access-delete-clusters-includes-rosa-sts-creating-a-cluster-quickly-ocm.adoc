= Creating a cluster quickly using {cluster-manager}

When using {cluster-manager-first} to create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster that uses the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you can select the default options to create the cluster quickly.

Before you can use {cluster-manager} to deploy ROSA with STS clusters, you must associate your AWS account with your Red Hat organization and create the required account-wide STS roles and policies.
