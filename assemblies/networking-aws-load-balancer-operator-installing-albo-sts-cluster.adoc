= Preparing for the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a cluster using the AWS {sts-full}
:context: albo-sts-cluster

toc::[]

You can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses STS. Follow these steps to prepare your cluster before installing the Operator.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator relies on the `CredentialsRequest` object to bootstrap the Operator and the AWS Load Balancer Controller. The AWS Load Balancer Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available.

== Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

An additional AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is required to successfully install the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses STS. The IAM role is required to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The AWS Load Balancer Operator generates the `CredentialsRequest` object with the IAM role to bootstrap itself.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-configuring_installing-aws-customizations[the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`)] and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.

Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.

== Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller

The `CredentialsRequest` object for the AWS Load Balancer Controller must be set with a manually provisioned IAM role.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using xref:../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-configuring_installing-aws-customizations[the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`)] and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.

Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.
