= Configuring an OpenID identity provider


Configure an OpenID identity provider to integrate with an OpenID Connect identity provider using an link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Authentication Operator in {product-title} requires that the configured
OpenID Connect identity provider implements the
link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Discovery]
specification.
====

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity
provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the Issuer URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name,
display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one
with a non-empty value is used. The standard claims are:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]

shorthand name that the user wants to be referred to as, such as `janedoe`. Typically
a value that corresponding to the user's login or username in the authentication
system, such as username or email.

|`email`
|Email address.

|`name`
