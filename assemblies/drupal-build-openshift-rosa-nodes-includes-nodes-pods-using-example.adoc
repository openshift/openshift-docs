= Example pod configurations

{product-title} leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one or more containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can be defined, deployed, and managed.

The following is an example definition of a pod. It demonstrates many features of pods, most of which are discussed in other topics and thus only briefly mentioned here:

.`Pod` object definition (YAML)

<1> Pods can be "tagged" with one or more labels, which can then be used to select and manage groups of pods in a single operation. The labels are stored in key/value format in the `metadata` hash.
<2> The pod restart policy with possible values `Always`, `OnFailure`, and `Never`. The default value is `Always`.
<3> {product-title} defines a security context for containers which specifies whether they are allowed to run as privileged containers, run as a user of their choice, and more. The default context is very restrictive but administrators can modify this as needed.
<4> `containers` specifies an array of one or more container definitions.
<5> The container specifies where external storage volumes are mounted within the container.
<6> Specify the volumes to provide for the pod. Volumes mount at the specified path. Do not mount to the container root, `/`, or any path that is the same in the host and the container. This can corrupt your host system if the container is sufficiently privileged, such as the host `/dev/pts` files. It is safe to mount the host by using `/host`.
<7> Each container in the pod is instantiated from its own container image.
<8> The pod defines storage volumes that are available to its container(s) to use.

If you attach persistent volumes that have high file counts to pods, those pods can fail or can take a long time to start. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6221251[When using Persistent Volumes with high file counts in OpenShift, why do pods fail to start or take an excessive amount of time to achieve "Ready" state?].

[NOTE]
====
This pod definition does not include attributes that are filled by {product-title} automatically after the pod is created and its lifecycle begins. The link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/[Kubernetes pod documentation] has details about the functionality and purpose of pods.
