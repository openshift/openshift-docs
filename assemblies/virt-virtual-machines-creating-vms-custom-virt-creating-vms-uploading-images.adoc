You can create virtual machines (VMs) by uploading operating system images from your local machine.

You can create a Windows VM by uploading a Windows image to a PVC. Then you clone the PVC when you create the VM.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms_custom/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.

You must also install xref:../../../virt/virtual_machines/creating_vms_custom/virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent.adoc#installing-virtio-drivers[VirtIO drivers] on Windows VMs.
