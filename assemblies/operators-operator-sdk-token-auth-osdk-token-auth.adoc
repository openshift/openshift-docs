= Token authentication for Operators on cloud providers

toc::[]

Many cloud providers can enable authentication by using account tokens that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials.

{product-title} includes the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) to manage cloud provider credentials as custom resource definitions (CRDs). The CCO syncs on `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) to allow {product-title} components to request cloud provider credentials with any specific permissions required.

Previously, on clusters where the CCO is in _manual mode_, Operators managed by Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) often provided detailed instructions in the OperatorHub for how users could manually provision any required cloud credentials.

Starting in {product-title} 4.14, the CCO can detect when it is running on clusters enabled to use short-term credentials on certain cloud providers. It can then semi-automate provisioning certain credentials, provided that the Operator author has enabled their Operator to support the updated CCO.
