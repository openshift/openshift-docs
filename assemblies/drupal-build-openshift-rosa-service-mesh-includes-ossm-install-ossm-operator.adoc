[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with {SMProductName} 2.5, {JaegerName} and {es-op} are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Red{nbsp}Hat will provide bug fixes and support for these features during the current release lifecycle, but this feature will no longer receive enhancements and will be removed. As an alternative to {JaegerName}, you can use {TempoName} instead.

[NOTE]
====
If you have already installed the {es-op} as part of OpenShift {logging-uc}, you do not need to install the {es-op} again. The {JaegerName} Operator creates the Elasticsearch instance using the installed {es-op}.
