====
Do not set this feature gate on production clusters. You will not be able to upgrade your cluster after applying the feature gate, and it cannot be undone.
====

.Procedure

. Log in to the {product-title} web console using your credentials.

. Enable ACM in the administrator perspective by navigating from *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *Console* `console.operator.openshift.io` -> *Console Plugins* and click *Enable* for `acm`.

. A pop-up window will appear notifying you that updating the enablement of this console plugin will prompt for the console to be refreshed once it has been updated. Select `Enable` and click *Save*.

. Repeat the previous two steps for the `mce` console plugin immediately after enabling `acm`.

. A pop-up window that states that a web console update is available will appear a few moments after you enable. Click *Refresh the web console* in the pop-up window to update.
+
[NOTE]
====
You might see the pop-up window to refresh the web console twice if the second redeployment has not occurred by the time you click *Refresh the web console*.
====

** *local-cluster* and *All Clusters* is now visible above the perspectives in the navigation section.

. Enable the feature gate by navigating from *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *FeatureGate*, and edit the YAML template as follows:
