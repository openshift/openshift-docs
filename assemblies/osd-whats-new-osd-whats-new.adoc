With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} is a complete {OCP} cluster provided as a cloud service, configured for high availability, and dedicated to a single customer.

{product-title} is professionally managed by Red Hat and hosted on {GCP} or {AWS}. Each {product-title} cluster includes a fully managed link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/architecture/control-plane[control plane] (Control and Infrastructure nodes), application nodes, installation and management by Red Hat Site Reliability Engineers (SRE), premium Red Hat Support, and cluster services such as logging, metrics, monitoring, notifications portal, and a cluster portal.

{product-title} clusters are available on the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console]. With the Red Hat {cluster-manager} application, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

== New changes and updates

[id="osd-q2-2024_{context}"]
=== Q2 2024

* **Cluster delete protection.** {product-title} on {GCP}  users can now enable the cluster delete protection option, which helps to prevent users from accidentally deleting a cluster. For more information, see xref:../osd_install_access_delete_cluster/creating-a-gcp-cluster.adoc#osd-create-gcp-cluster-ccs_osd-creating-a-cluster-on-gcp[Creating a cluster on GCP with CCS].

* **CSI Operator update.** {product-title} is capable of provisioning persistent volumes (PVs) using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for Google Compute Platform (GCP) Filestore Storage. For more information, see xref:../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-google-cloud-file-overview[Google Compute Platform Filestore CSI Driver Operator].

* **Support for new GCP instances.** {product-title} now supports more worker node types and sizes on Google Cloud Platform. For more information, see xref:../osd_architecture/osd_policy/osd-service-definition.adoc#gcp-compute-types_osd-service-definition[Google Cloud compute types].

[id="osd-q1-2024_{context}"]
=== Q1 2024

* **{product-title} regions added.** {product-title} on {GCP} is now available in the Delhi, India (`asia-south2`) region. For more information on region availabilities, see xref:../osd_architecture/osd_policy/osd-service-definition.adoc#regions-availability-zones_osd-service-definition[Regions and availability zones].

* **Policy constraint update.** {product-title} on {GCP} users are now allowed to deploy clusters with the `constraints/iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` constraint in place. This feature allows users to restrict the set of identities that are allowed to be used in Identity and Access Management policies, further enhancing overall security for their resources.

[id="osd-q4-2023_{context}"]
=== Q4 2023

* **Policy constraint update.** {product-title} on {GCP} users can now enable UEFISecureBoot during cluster installation, as required by the GCP ShieldVM policy. This new feature adds further protection from boot or kernel-level malware or rootkits.

* **Cluster install update.** {product-title} clusters can now be installed on {GCP} shared VPCs. For more information, see xref:../osd_install_access_delete_cluster/creating-a-gcp-cluster.adoc#osd-create-gcp-cluster-ccs_osd-creating-a-cluster-on-gcp[Creating a cluster on GCP with CCS].

* **{product-title} on Google Cloud Marketplace availability.** When creating an {product-title} (OSD) cluster on Google Cloud through the Hybrid Cloud Console, customers can now select Google Cloud Marketplace as their preferred billing model. This billing model allows Red Hat customers to take advantage of their link:https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds[Google Committed Use Discounts (CUD)] towards {product-title} purchased through the Google Cloud Marketplace. For more information, see xref:../osd_install_access_delete_cluster/creating-a-gcp-cluster.adoc#osd-create-cluster-gcp-account_osd-creating-a-cluster-on-gcp[Creating a cluster on GCP with Google Cloud Marketplace].
