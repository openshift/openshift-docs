|Component|Description

|Prometheus Operator
|The Prometheus Operator (PO) in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project creates, configures, and manages Prometheus and Thanos Ruler instances in the same project.

|Prometheus
|Prometheus is the monitoring system through which monitoring is provided for user-defined projects. Prometheus sends alerts to Alertmanager for processing.

|Thanos Ruler
|The Thanos Ruler is a rule evaluation engine for Prometheus that is deployed as a separate process. In {product-title}

, Thanos Ruler provides rule and alerting evaluation for the monitoring of user-defined projects.

|Alertmanager
