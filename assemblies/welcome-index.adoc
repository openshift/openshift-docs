- **xref:../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles.adoc#nodes-cluster-worker-latency-profiles[Improving cluster stability in high latency environments by using worker latency profiles]**: If your network has latency issues, you can use one of three worker latency profiles to help ensure that your control plane does not accidentally evict pods in case it cannot reach a worker node. You can configure or modify the profile at any time during the life of the cluster.

=== Observe a cluster

- **xref:../observability/logging/cluster-logging.adoc#cluster-logging[OpenShift Logging]**: Learn about logging and configure different logging components, such as log storage, log collectors, and the logging web console plugin.

- **xref:../observability/distr_tracing/distr_tracing_arch/distr-tracing-architecture.adoc#distr-tracing-architecture[Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform]**: Store and visualize large volumes of requests passing through distributed systems, across the whole stack of microservices, and under heavy loads. Use the distributed tracing platform for monitoring distributed transactions, gathering insights into your instrumented services, network profiling, performance and latency optimization, root cause analysis, and troubleshooting the interaction between components in modern cloud-native microservices-based applications.

- **xref:../observability/otel/otel-installing.adoc#install-otel[Red Hat build of OpenTelemetry]**: Instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry traces, metrics, and logs to analyze and understand your software's performance and behavior. Use open source backends like Tempo or Prometheus, or use commercial offerings. Learn a single set of APIs and conventions, and own the data that you generate.

- **xref:../observability/network_observability/network-observability-overview.adoc#network-observability-overview[Network Observability]**: Observe network traffic for {product-title} clusters by using eBPF technology to create and enrich network flows. You can xref:../observability/network_observability/metrics-alerts-dashboards.adoc#metrics-alerts-dashboards_metrics-alerts-dashboards[view dashboards, customize alerts], and xref:../observability/network_observability/observing-network-traffic.adoc#network-observability-trafficflow_nw-observe-network-traffic[analyze network flow] information for further insight and troubleshooting.

Learn to  xref:../observability/monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#configuring-the-monitoring-stack[configure the monitoring stack].
After configuring monitoring, use the web console to access xref:../observability/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[monitoring dashboards]. In addition to infrastructure metrics, you can also scrape and view metrics for your own services.

- **xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#about-remote-health-monitoring_about-remote-health-monitoring[Remote health monitoring]**: {product-title} collects anonymized aggregated information about your cluster. By using Telemetry and the Insights Operator, this data is received by Red Hat and used to improve {product-title}. You can view the xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring_showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring[data collected by remote health monitoring].

- **xref:../observability/power_monitoring/power-monitoring-overview.adoc#power-monitoring-overview[{PM-title-c} (Technology Preview)]**: You can use {PM-title} to monitor the power usage and identify power-consuming containers running in an {product-title} cluster. {PM-shortname-c} collects and exports energy-related system statistics from various components, such as CPU and DRAM. {PM-shortname-c} provides granular power consumption data for Kubernetes pods, namespaces, and nodes.

== Cluster administrator activities

While cluster maintenance and host configuration is performed by the Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, other ongoing tasks on your {product-title} {product-version} cluster can be performed by {product-title} cluster administrators. As an {product-title} cluster administrator, the documentation helps you:

- *Manage Dedicated Administrators*: Grant or revoke permissions to `dedicated admin` users.
- *Work with Logging*: Learn about OpenShift Logging and configure the Cluster Logging Operator.
- *Monitor clusters*: Learn to use the Web UI to access monitoring dashboards.
- *Manage nodes*: Learn to manage nodes, including configuring machine pools and autoscaling.
