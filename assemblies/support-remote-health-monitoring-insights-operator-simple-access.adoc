= Importing simple content access entitlements with Insights Operator

:FeatureName: `InsightsOperatorPullingSCA`

toc::[]

Insights Operator periodically imports your simple content access entitlements from {cluster-manager-url} and stores them in the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. Simple content access is a capability in Red Hat subscription tools which simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. This feature makes it easier to consume the content provided by your Red Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling.

[NOTE]
====
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the Insights Operator configuration using a *support secret* in the `openshift-config` namespace. Red Hat Insights now supports the creation of a `ConfigMap` object to configure the Operator. The Operator gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
====

The Insights Operator imports simple content access entitlements every eight hours, but can be configured or disabled using the *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-insights` namespace.

[NOTE]
=====
Simple content access must be enabled in Red Hat Subscription Management for the importing to function.
