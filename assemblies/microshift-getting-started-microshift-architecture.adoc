Learn the specifics of {product-title} architecture including design intent, how it differs from {oke}, and API compatibility.

[id="microshift-architectural-design_{context}"]
== Architectural design
{microshift-short} is a single-node container orchestration runtime designed to extend the benefits of using containers for running applications to low-resource edge environments. Because {microshift-short} is primarily a platform for deploying applications, only the APIs and features essential to operating in edge and small form factor computing environments are included.

For example, {microshift-short} contains only the following Kubernetes cluster capabilities:

* Networking
* Ingress
* Storage

{microshift-short} also provides the following Kubernetes functions:

* Orchestration
* Security

To optimize your deployments, use {microshift-short} with a compatible operating system, such as {op-system-ostree-first}. Using {microshift-short} and {op-system-ostree-first} together forms {op-system-bundle}. Virtual machines are handled by the operating system in {microshift-short} deployments.

The following operational differences from {oke} can help you understand where {microshift-short} can be deployed:

== Key differences from {oke}

* Devices with {microshift-short} installed are self-managing
* Compatible with RPM-OStree-based systems
* Uses only the APIs needed for essential functions, such as security and runtime controls
* Enables a subset of commands from the OpenShift CLI (`oc`) tool
* Does not support workload high availability (HA) or horizontal scalability with the addition of worker nodes

The figure "{product-title} differences from {oke}" shows that {oke} has the same cluster capabilities as {product-title}, and adds the following information:

* Install
* Over-the-air updates
* Cluster Operators
* Operator Lifecycle Manager
* Monitoring
* Logging
* Registry
* Authorization
* Console
* Cloud Integration
* Virtual Machines (VMs) through {VirtProductName}

In {oke} and other {OCP} deployments, all of the components from the operating system through the cluster capabilities work as one comprehensive unit, with full cluster services for a multi-node Kubernetes workload. With {microshift-short}, functions such as over-the-air-updates, monitoring, and logging, are performed by the operating system.

== {microshift-short} OpenShift APIs

In addition to standard Kubernetes APIs, {microshift-short} includes a small subset of the APIs supported by {OCP}.
