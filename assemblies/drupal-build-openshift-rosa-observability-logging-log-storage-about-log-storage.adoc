= About log storage
:context: about-log-storage


You can use an internal Loki or Elasticsearch log store on your cluster for storing logs, or you can use a xref:logging-create-clf_configuring-log-forwarding[`ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR)] to forward logs to an external store.

== Log storage types

Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system offered as an alternative to Elasticsearch as a log store for the {logging}.

Elasticsearch indexes incoming log records completely during ingestion. Loki only indexes a few fixed labels during ingestion and defers more complex parsing until after the logs have been stored. This means Loki can collect logs more quickly.
