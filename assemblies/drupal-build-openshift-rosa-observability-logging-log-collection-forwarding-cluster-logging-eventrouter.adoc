= Collecting and storing Kubernetes events
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]


The {product-title} Event Router is a pod that watches Kubernetes events and logs them for collection by the {logging}. You must manually deploy the Event Router.

The Event Router collects events from all projects and writes them to `STDOUT`. The collector then forwards those events to the store defined in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Event Router adds additional load to Fluentd and can impact the number of other log messages that can be processed.
