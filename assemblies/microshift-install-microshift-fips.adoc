toc::[]

You can use FIPS mode with RPM-based installations of {microshift-short} on {op-system-base-full} {op-system-version-major}.

* To enable FIPS mode in {microshift-short} containers, the worker machine kernel must be enabled to run in FIPS mode before the machine starts.
* Using FIPS with {op-system-ostree-first} images is not supported.
