There are two types of {logging} updates: minor release updates (5.y.z) and major release updates (5.y).

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Automatic* update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Manual* update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-upgrading-operators.adoc#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators[Manually approving a pending Operator update].

[id="cluster-logging-upgrading-major"]
