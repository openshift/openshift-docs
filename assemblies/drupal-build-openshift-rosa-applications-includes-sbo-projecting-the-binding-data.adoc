= Projecting the binding data

Depending on your workload requirements and environment, you can choose to project the binding data either as files or environment variables.

.Prerequisites

* You understand the following concepts:
** Environment and requirements of your workload, and how it works with the provided services.
** Consumption of the binding data in your workload resource.
** Configuration of how the final path for data projection is computed for the default method.
* The binding data is exposed from the backing service.

.Procedure

. To project the binding data as files, determine the destination folder by ensuring that the existing `SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT` environment variable is present in the container where your workload runs.
. To project the binding data as environment variables, set the value for the `.spec.bindAsFiles` parameter to `false` from the `ServiceBinding` resource in the custom resource (CR).
