= Docker builds using Red Hat Satellite subscriptions

Docker strategy builds can use Red Hat Satellite repositories to install subscription content.

.Prerequisites

* You have added the entitlement keys and Satellite repository configurations as build volumes.

.Procedure

* Use the following example to create a `Dockerfile` for installing content with Satellite:
+
[source,docker]
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/ubi9/ubi:latest
RUN rm -rf /etc/rhsm-host # <1>
RUN yum --enablerepo=codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms install \ # <2>
    nss_wrapper \
    uid_wrapper -y && \
    yum clean all -y
RUN ln -s /run/secrets/rhsm /etc/rhsm-host # <3>
----
<1> You must include the command to remove the `/etc/rhsm-host` directory and all its contents in your Dockerfile before executing any `yum` or `dnf` commands.
<2> Contact your Satellite system administrator to find the correct repositories for the build's installed packages.
<3> You must restore the `/etc/rhsm-host` symbolic link to keep your image compatible with other Red Hat container images.
