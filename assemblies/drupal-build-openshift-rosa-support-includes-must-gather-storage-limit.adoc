= Changing the must-gather storage limit

When using the `oc adm must-gather` command to collect data the default maximum storage for the information is 30% of the storage capacity of the container. After the 30% limit is reached the container is killed and the gathering process stops. Information already gathered is downloaded to your local storage. To run the must-gather command again, you need either a container with more storage capacity or to adjust the maximum volume percentage.

If the container reaches the storage limit, an error message similar to the following example is generated.

.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Disk usage exceeds the volume percentage of 30% for mounted directory. Exiting...

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

.Procedure

* Run the `oc adm must-gather` command with the `volume-percentage` flag. The new value cannot exceed 100.
