You install the {oadp-first} with {aws-first} by installing the OADP Operator. The Operator installs link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/[Velero {velero-version}].

include::snippets/oadp-mtc-operator.adoc[]

You configure {aws-short} for Velero, create a default `Secret`, and then install the Data Protection Application. For more details, see xref:../../..//backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-installing-operator.adoc#oadp-installing-operator-doc[Installing the OADP Operator].

To install the OADP Operator in a restricted network environment, you must first disable the default OperatorHub sources and mirror the Operator catalog. See xref:../../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks] for details.

You can install {oadp-short} on an AWS {sts-first} (AWS STS) cluster manually. Amazon {aws-short} provides {aws-short} STS as a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for users. You use STS to provide trusted users with temporary access to resources via API calls, your {aws-short} console, or the {aws-short} command line interface (CLI).

Before installing {oadp-first}, you must set up role and policy credentials for {oadp-short} so that it can use the {aws-full} API.

This process is performed in the following two stages:

. Prepare {aws-short} credentials.
. Install the OADP Operator and give it an IAM role.
