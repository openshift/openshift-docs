= Controlling nodes with special hardware using taints and tolerations

In a cluster where a small subset of nodes have specialized hardware, you can use taints and tolerations to keep pods that do not need the specialized hardware off of those nodes, leaving the nodes for pods that do need the specialized hardware. You can also require pods that need specialized hardware to use specific nodes.

You can achieve this by adding a toleration to pods that need the special hardware and tainting the nodes that have the specialized hardware.

.Procedure

To ensure nodes with specialized hardware are reserved for specific pods:

. Add a toleration to pods that need the special hardware.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
#...
spec:
  tolerations:
    - key: "disktype"
      value: "ssd"
      operator: "Equal"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
      tolerationSeconds: 3600
#...
----

. Taint the nodes that have the specialized hardware using one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:NoSchedule
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm taint nodes <node-name> disktype=ssd:PreferNoSchedule
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to add the taint:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Node
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my_node
#...
spec:
  taints:
    - key: disktype
      value: ssd
      effect: PreferNoSchedule
#...
----
