= BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy

`BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` (BANP) is a cluster-scoped custom resource definition (CRD). As a {product-title} administrator, you can use BANP to setup and enforce optional baseline network policy rules that are overridable by users using `NetworkPolicy` objects if need be. Rule actions for BANP are `allow` or `deny`.

The `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resource is a cluster singleton object that can be used as a guardrail policy incase a passed traffic policy does not match any `NetworkPolicy` objects in the cluster. A BANP can also be used as a default security model that provides guardrails that intra-cluster traffic is blocked by default and a user will need to use `NetworkPolicy` objects to allow known traffic. You must use `default` as the name when creating a BANP resource.

A BANP allows administrators to specify:

* A `subject` that consists of a set of namespaces or namespace.

* A list of ingress rules to be applied for all ingress traffic towards the `subject`.

* A list of egress rules to be applied for all egress traffic from the `subject`.

[id="BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy-default-deny-example"_{context}]
== BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy Deny example
The following BANP singleton ensures that the administrator has set up a default deny policy for all ingress monitoring traffic coming into the tenants at `internal` security level. When combined with the "AdminNetworkPolicy Pass example", this deny policy acts as a guardrail policy for all ingress traffic that is passed by the ANP `pass-monitoring` policy.

You can use an `AdminNetworkPolicy` resource with a `Pass` value for the `action` field in conjunction with the `BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy` resource to create a multi-tenant policy. This multi-tenant policy allows one tenant to collect monitoring data on their application while simultaneously not collecting data from a second tenant.

As an administrator, if you apply both the "AdminNetworkPolicy `Pass` action example" and the "BaselineAdminNetwork Policy `Deny` example", tenants are then left with the ability to choose to create a `NetworkPolicy` resource that will be evaluated before the BANP.

For example, Tenant 1 can set up the following `NetworkPolicy` resource to monitor ingress traffic:

.Example `NetworkPolicy`

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-monitoring

  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring
# ...
----
====

In this scenario, Tenant 1's policy would be evaluated after the "AdminNetworkPolicy `Pass` action example" and before the "BaselineAdminNetwork Policy `Deny` example", which denies all ingress monitoring traffic coming into tenants with `security` level `internal`. With Tenant 1's `NetworkPolicy` object in place, they will be able to collect data on their application. Tenant 2, however, who does not have any `NetworkPolicy` objects in place, will not be able to collect data. As an administrator, you have not by default monitored internal tenants, but instead, you created a BANP that allows tenants to use `NetworkPolicy` objects to override the default behavior of your BANP.
