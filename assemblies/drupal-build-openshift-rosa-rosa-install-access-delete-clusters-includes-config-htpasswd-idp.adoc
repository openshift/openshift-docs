[id="config-htpasswd-idp_{context}"]
= Configuring an htpasswd identity provider

Configure an htpasswd identity provider to create a single, static user with cluster administration privileges. You can log in to your cluster as the user to troubleshoot issues.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The htpasswd identity provider option is included only to enable the creation of a single, static administration user. htpasswd is not supported as a general-use identity provider for {product-title}.
====

.Procedure

. From {cluster-manager-url}, navigate to the *Clusters* page and select your cluster.

. Select *Access control* -> *Identity providers*.

. Click *Add identity provider*.

. Select *HTPasswd* from the *Identity Provider* drop-down menu.

. Add a unique name in the *Name* field for the identity provider.

. Use the suggested username and password for the static user, or create your own.
+
[NOTE]
====
The credentials defined in this step are not visible after you select *Add* in the following step. If you lose the credentials, you must recreate the identity provider and define the credentials again.
====

. Select *Add* to create the htpasswd identity provider and the single, static user.

. Grant the static user permission to manage the cluster:
.. Under *Access control* -> *Cluster Roles and Access*, select *Add user*.
.. Enter the *User ID* of the static user that you created in the preceding step.
ifdef::osd-distro[]
.. Select a *Group.*
** If you are installing {product-title} using the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) infrastructure type, choose either the `dedicated-admins` or `cluster-admins` group. Users in the `dedicated-admins` group have standard administrative privileges for {product-title}. Users in the `cluster-admins` group have full administrative access to the cluster.
** If you are installing {product-title} using the Red Hat cloud account infrastructure type, the `dedicated-admins` group is automatically selected.
endif::osd-distro[]
ifdef::rosa-distro[]
.. Select a *Group*. Users in the `dedicated-admins` group have standard administrative privileges for {product-title}. Users in the `cluster-admins` group have full administrative access to the cluster.
endif::rosa-distro[]
.. Select *Add user* to grant the administration privileges to the user.

.Verification

* The configured htpasswd identity provider is visible on the *Access control* -> *Identity providers* page.
+
[NOTE]
====
After creating the identity provider, synchronization usually completes within two minutes. You can log in to the cluster as the user after the htpasswd identity provider becomes available.
====
* The single, administrative user is visible on the *Access control* -> *Cluster Roles and Access* page. The administration group membership of the user is also displayed.
