If your service mesh application is constructed with a complex array of microservices, you can use {SMProductName} to customize the security of the communication between those services. The infrastructure of {product-title} along with the traffic management features of {SMProductShortName} help you manage the complexity of your applications and secure microservices.

.Before you begin

If you have a project, add your project to the xref:ossm-member-roll-create_ossm-create-mesh[`ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource].

If you don't have a project, install the xref:ossm-tutorial-bookinfo-overview_ossm-create-mesh[Bookinfo sample application] and add it to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource. The sample application helps illustrate security concepts.
