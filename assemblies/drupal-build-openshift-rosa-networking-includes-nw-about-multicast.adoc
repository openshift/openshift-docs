= About multicast

With IP multicast, data is broadcast to many IP addresses simultaneously.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* At this time, multicast is best used for low-bandwidth coordination or service discovery and not a high-bandwidth solution.
* By default, network policies affect all connections in a namespace. However, multicast is unaffected by network policies. If multicast is enabled in the same namespace as your network policies, it is always allowed, even if there is a `deny-all` network policy. Cluster administrators should consider the implications to the exemption of multicast from network policies before enabling it.
====

Multicast traffic between {product-title} pods is disabled by default. If you are using the {sdn} network plugin, you can enable multicast on a per-project basis.

ifdef::openshift-sdn[]
When using the OpenShift SDN network plugin in `networkpolicy` isolation mode:

* Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the project, regardless of `NetworkPolicy` objects. Pods might be able to communicate over multicast even when they cannot communicate over unicast.
* Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will never be delivered to pods in any other project, even if there are `NetworkPolicy` objects that allow communication between the projects.

When using the OpenShift SDN network plugin in `multitenant` isolation mode:

* Multicast packets sent by a pod will be delivered to all other pods in the
project.
* Multicast packets sent by a pod in one project will be delivered to pods in
other projects only if each project is joined together and multicast is enabled
in each joined project.
