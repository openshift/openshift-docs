You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack-first}.
ifdef::openshift-origin[{product-title} version {product-version} supports OpenStack Train.]

[id="preparing-to-install-on-openstack-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You reviewed details about the xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You read the documentation on xref:../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].

== Choosing a method to install {product-title} on OpenStack

You can install {product-title} on installer-provisioned or user-provisioned infrastructure. The default installation type uses installer-provisioned infrastructure, where the installation program provisions the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. You can also install {product-title} on infrastructure that you provision. If you do not use infrastructure that the installation program provisions, you must manage and maintain the cluster resources yourself.

See xref:../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#installation-process_architecture-installation[Installation process] for more information about installer-provisioned and user-provisioned installation processes.

=== Installing a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {rh-openstack-first} infrastructure that is provisioned by the {product-title} installation program, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-custom.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-custom[Installing a cluster on OpenStack with customizations]**: You can install a customized cluster on {rh-openstack}. The installation program allows for some customization to be applied at the installation stage. Many other customization options are available xref:../../post_installation_configuration/cluster-tasks.adoc#post-install-cluster-tasks[post-installation].

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-installer-restricted.adoc#installing-openstack-installer-restricted[Installing a cluster on OpenStack in a restricted network]**: You can install {product-title} on {rh-openstack} in a restricted or disconnected network by creating an internal mirror of the installation release content. You can use this method to install a cluster that does not require an active internet connection to obtain the software components. You can also use this installation method to ensure that your clusters only use container images that satisfy your organizational controls on external content.

[id="choosing-an-method-to-install-ocp-on-openstack-user-provisioned"]
=== Installing a cluster on user-provisioned infrastructure

You can install a cluster on {rh-openstack} infrastructure that you provision, by using one of the following methods:

* **xref:../../installing/installing_openstack/installing-openstack-user.adoc#installing-openstack-user[Installing a cluster on OpenStack on your own infrastructure]**: You can install {product-title} on user-provisioned {rh-openstack} infrastructure. By using this installation method, you can integrate your cluster with existing infrastructure and modifications. For installations on user-provisioned infrastructure, you must create all {rh-openstack} resources, like Nova servers, Neutron ports, and security groups. You can use the provided Ansible playbooks to assist with the deployment process.
