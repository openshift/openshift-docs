Use the *Topology* view for the following purposes:

* Grouping multiple components within an application.

* Connecting components with each other.

* Connecting multiple resources to services with labels.

You can either use a binding or a visual connector to connect components.


A binding connection between the components can be established only if the target node is an Operator-backed service. This is indicated by the *Create a binding connector* tool-tip which appears when you drag an arrow to such a target node. When an application is connected to a service by using a binding connector a `ServiceBinding` resource is created. Then, the {servicebinding-title} controller projects the necessary binding data into the application deployment. After the request is successful, the application is redeployed establishing an interaction between the connected components.

A visual connector establishes only a visual connection between the components, depicting an intent to connect. No interaction between the components is established. If the target node is not an Operator-backed service the *Create a visual connector* tool-tip is displayed when you drag an arrow to a target node.
