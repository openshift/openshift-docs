== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `address`
| `string`
| Address is a host that OLM can use to connect to a pre-existing registry. Format: <registry-host or ip>:<port> Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc. Ignored when the Image field is set.

| `configMap`
| `string`
| ConfigMap is the name of the ConfigMap to be used to back a configmap-server registry. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeConfigmap or SourceTypeInternal.

| `description`
| `string`
| 

| `displayName`
| `string`
| Metadata

| `grpcPodConfig`
| `object`
| GrpcPodConfig exposes different overrides for the pod spec of the CatalogSource Pod. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc and Image is set.

| `icon`
| `object`
| 

| `image`
| `string`
| Image is an operator-registry container image to instantiate a registry-server with. Only used when SourceType = SourceTypeGrpc. If present, the address field is ignored.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| Priority field assigns a weight to the catalog source to prioritize them so that it can be consumed by the dependency resolver. Usage: Higher weight indicates that this catalog source is preferred over lower weighted catalog sources during dependency resolution. The range of the priority value can go from positive to negative in the range of int32. The default value to a catalog source with unassigned priority would be 0. The catalog source with the same priority values will be ranked lexicographically based on its name.

| `publisher`
| `string`
| 

| `runAsRoot`
| `boolean`
| RunAsRoot allows admins to indicate that they wish to run the CatalogSource pod in a privileged pod as root.  This should only be enabled when running older catalog images which could not be run as non-root.

| `secrets`
| `array (string)`
| Secrets represent set of secrets that can be used to access the contents of the catalog. It is best to keep this list small, since each will need to be tried for every catalog entry.

| `sourceType`
| `string`
| SourceType is the type of source

| `updateStrategy`
| `object`
| UpdateStrategy defines how updated catalog source images can be discovered Consists of an interval that defines polling duration and an embedded strategy type

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `affinity`
| `object`
| Affinity is the catalog source's pod's affinity.

| `extractContent`
| `object`
| ExtractContent configures the gRPC catalog Pod to extract catalog metadata from the provided index image and use a well-known version of the `opm` server to expose it. The catalog index image that this CatalogSource is configured to use *must* be using the file-based catalogs in order to utilize this feature.

| `memoryTarget`
| `integer-or-string`
| MemoryTarget configures the $GOMEMLIMIT value for the gRPC catalog Pod. This is a soft memory limit for the server, which the runtime will attempt to meet but makes no guarantees that it will do so. If this value is set, the Pod will have the following modifications made to the container running the server: - the $GOMEMLIMIT environment variable will be set to this value in bytes - the memory request will be set to this value 
 This field should be set if it's desired to reduce the footprint of a catalog server as much as possible, or if a catalog being served is very large and needs more than the default allocation. If your index image has a file- system cache, determine a good approximation for this value by doubling the size of the package cache at /tmp/cache/cache/packages.json in the index image. 
 This field is best-effort; if unset, no default will be used and no Pod memory limit or $GOMEMLIMIT value will be set.

| `nodeSelector`
| `object (string)`
| NodeSelector is a selector which must be true for the pod to fit on a node. Selector which must match a node's labels for the pod to be scheduled on that node.

| `priorityClassName`
| `string`
| If specified, indicates the pod's priority. If not specified, the pod priority will be default or zero if there is no default.

| `securityContextConfig`
| `string`
| SecurityContextConfig can be one of `legacy` or `restricted`. The CatalogSource's pod is either injected with the right pod.spec.securityContext and pod.spec.container[*].securityContext values to allow the pod to run in Pod Security Admission (PSA) `restricted` mode, or doesn't set these values at all, in which case the pod can only be run in PSA `baseline` or `privileged` namespaces. Currently if the SecurityContextConfig is unspecified, the default value of `legacy` is used. Specifying a value other than `legacy` or `restricted` result in a validation error. When using older catalog images, which could not be run in `restricted` mode, the SecurityContextConfig should be set to `legacy`. 
 In a future version will the default will be set to `restricted`, catalog maintainers should rebuild their catalogs with a version of opm that supports running catalogSource pods in `restricted` mode to prepare for these changes. 
 More information about PSA can be found here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/'

| `tolerations`
| `array`
| Tolerations are the catalog source's pod's tolerations.

| `tolerations[]`
| `object`
| The pod this Toleration is attached to tolerates any taint that matches the triple <key,value,effect> using the matching operator <operator>.

| `labelSelector`
| `object`
| A label query over a set of resources, in this case pods. If it's null, this PodAffinityTerm matches with no Pods.

| `matchLabelKeys`
| `array (string)`
| MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `LabelSelector` as `key in (value)` to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector. Also, MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set. This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

| `mismatchLabelKeys`

  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another. This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition. This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon. For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition. Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field, and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API. The value should be a CamelCase string. This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase. --- Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important. The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)

=== .status.configMapReference
Description::
+
--
ConfigMapReference (deprecated) is the reference to the ConfigMap containing the catalog source's configuration, when the catalog source is a ConfigMap

| 

| `namespace`
| `string`
| 

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| 

| `uid`
| `string`
| UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

| Parameter | Type | Description
| `dryRun`
| `string`
| When present, indicates that modifications should not be persisted. An invalid or unrecognized dryRun directive will result in an error response and no further processing of the request. Valid values are: - All: all dry run stages will be processed
| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
