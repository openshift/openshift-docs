= Building and uploading a container disk

You can build a virtual machine (VM) image into a container disk and upload it to a registry.

The size of a container disk is limited by the maximum layer size of the registry where the container disk is hosted.

[NOTE]
====
For link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/[Red Hat Quay], you can change the maximum layer size by editing the YAML configuration file that is created when Red Hat Quay is first deployed.
====

.Prerequisites

* You must have `podman` installed.
* You must have a QCOW2 or RAW image file.

.Procedure

. Create a Dockerfile to build the VM image into a container image. The VM image must be owned by QEMU, which has a UID of `107`, and placed in the `/disk/` directory inside the container. Permissions for the `/disk/` directory must then be set to `0440`.
+
The following example uses the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) to handle these configuration changes in the first stage, and uses the minimal `scratch` image in the second stage to store the result:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest AS builder
ADD --chown=107:107 <vm_image>.qcow2 /disk/ \// <1>
RUN chmod 0440 /disk/*

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /disk/* /disk/
EOF
----
<1> Where `<vm_image>` is the image in either QCOW2 or RAW format. If you use a remote image, replace `<vm_image>.qcow2` with the complete URL.

. Build and tag the container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build -t <registry>/<container_disk_name>:latest .
----

. Push the container image to the registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push <registry>/<container_disk_name>:latest
----
