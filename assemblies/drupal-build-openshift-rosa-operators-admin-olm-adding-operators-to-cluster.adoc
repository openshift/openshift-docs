Using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM),

cluster administrators

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
administrators with the `dedicated-admin` role

can install OLM-based Operators to an {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
For information on how OLM handles updates for installed Operators colocated in the same namespace, as well as an alternative method for installing Operators with custom global Operator groups, see xref:olm-colocation[Multitenancy and Operator colocation].

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have downloaded the {cluster-manager-url-pull} as shown in _Obtaining the installation program_ in the installation documentation for your platform.
+
If you have the pull secret, add the `redhat-operators` catalog to the `OperatorHub` custom resource (CR) as shown in _Configuring {product-title} to use Red Hat Operators_.

.Next steps

* Install the Operator in the tenant Operator namespace. This task is more easily performed by using the OperatorHub in the web console instead of the CLI; for a detailed procedure, see xref:olm-installing-from-operatorhub-using-web-console_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Installing from OperatorHub using the web console].
+
[NOTE]
====
After completing the Operator installation, the Operator resides in the tenant Operator namespace and watches the tenant namespace, but neither the Operator's pod nor its service account are visible or usable by the tenant.

* xref:olm-multitenancy[Operators in multitenant clusters]

include::../includes/olm-installing-global-namespaces.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
.Next steps

* Install the desired Operator in your custom global namespace. Because the web console does not populate the *Installed Namespace* menu during Operator installation with custom global namespaces, this task can only be performed with the OpenShift CLI (`oc`). For a detailed procedure, see xref:olm-installing-operator-from-operatorhub-using-cli_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[Installing from OperatorHub using the CLI].
+
[NOTE]
====
When you initiate the Operator installation, if the Operator has dependencies, the dependencies are also automatically installed in the custom global namespace. As a result, it is then valid for the dependency Operators to have the same update policy and shared install plans.
