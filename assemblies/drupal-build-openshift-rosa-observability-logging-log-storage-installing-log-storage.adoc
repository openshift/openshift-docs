== Deploying a Loki log store

You can use the {loki-op} to deploy an internal Loki log store on your {product-title} cluster.
After install the {loki-op}, you must configure Loki object storage by creating a secret, and create a `LokiStack` custom resource (CR).

== Deploying a Loki log store on a cluster that uses short-term credentials

For some storage providers, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) during installation to implement short-term credentials. These credentials are created and managed outside the {product-title} cluster. xref:../../../authentication/managing_cloud_provider_credentials/cco-short-term-creds.adoc#cco-short-term-creds[Manual mode with short-term credentials for components].

[NOTE]
====
Short-term credential authentication must be configured during a new installation of {loki-op}, on a cluster that uses this credentials strategy. You cannot configure an existing cluster that uses a different credentials strategy to use this feature.
