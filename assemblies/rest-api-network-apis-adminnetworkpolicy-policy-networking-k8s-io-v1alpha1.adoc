| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| Property | Type | Description

| `egress`
| `array`
| Egress is the list of Egress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.
The relative precedence of egress rules within a single ANP object (all of
which share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the rule
is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
would take the highest precedence.
ANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.


Support: Core

| `egress[]`
| `object`
| AdminNetworkPolicyEgressRule describes an action to take on a particular
set of traffic originating from pods selected by a AdminNetworkPolicy's
Subject field.
<network-policy-api:experimental:validation>

| `ingress`
| `array`
| Ingress is the list of Ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.
The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single ANP object (all of
which share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the rule
is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress rules
would take the highest precedence.
ANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.


Support: Core

| `ingress[]`
| `object`
| AdminNetworkPolicyIngressRule describes an action to take on a particular
set of traffic destined for pods selected by an AdminNetworkPolicy's
Subject field.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| Priority is a value from 0 to 1000. Rules with lower priority values have
higher precedence, and are checked before rules with higher priority values.
All AdminNetworkPolicy rules have higher precedence than NetworkPolicy or
BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy rules
The behavior is undefined if two ANP objects have same priority.

is passed to any BaselineAdminNetworkPolicies that select the pod.

| Networks defines a way to select peers via CIDR blocks.
This is intended for representing entities that live outside the cluster,
which can't be selected by pods, namespaces and nodes peers, but note
that cluster-internal traffic will be checked against the rule as
well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.


Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be
IPv4 or IPv6, for example "10.0.0.0/8" or "fd00::/8".


Networks can have upto 25 CIDRs specified.

| matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| `matchExpressions[]`

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]

| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This may be an empty string.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
with respect to the current state of the instance.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason contains a programmatic identifier indicating the reason for the condition's last transition.
Producers of specific condition types may define expected values and meanings for this field,
and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
The value should be a CamelCase string.
This field may not be empty.

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
---
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
The regex it matches is (dns1123SubdomainFmt/)?(qualifiedNameFmt)
