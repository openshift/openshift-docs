Application developers need access to backing services to build and connect workloads. Connecting workloads to backing services is always a challenge because each service provider suggests a different way to access their secrets and consume them in a workload. In addition, manual configuration and maintenance of this binding together of workloads and backing services make the process tedious, inefficient, and error-prone.

The {servicebinding-title} enables application developers to easily bind workloads together with Operator-managed backing services, without any manual procedures to configure the binding connection.
