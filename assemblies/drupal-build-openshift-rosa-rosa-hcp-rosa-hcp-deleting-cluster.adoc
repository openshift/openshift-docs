= Deleting a {hcp-title} cluster
:context: rosa-hcp-deleting-cluster


If you want to delete a {hcp-title-first} cluster, you can use either the {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA command line interface (CLI) (`rosa`). After deleting your cluster, you can also delete the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources that are used by the cluster.

.Troubleshooting
* If the cluster cannot be deleted because of missing IAM roles, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/support/#rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deletion_rosa-troubleshooting-cluster-deployments[Repairing a cluster that cannot be deleted].
* If the cluster cannot be deleted for other reasons:
** Ensure that there are no add-ons for your cluster pending in the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Hybrid Cloud Console].
** Ensure that all AWS resources and dependencies have been deleted in the Amazon Web Console.
