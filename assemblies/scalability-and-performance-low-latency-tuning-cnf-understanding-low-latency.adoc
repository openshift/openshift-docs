Edge computing has a key role in reducing latency and congestion problems and improving application performance for telco and 5G network applications.
Maintaining a network architecture with the lowest possible latency is key for meeting the network performance requirements of 5G.
Compared to 4G technology, with an average latency of 50 ms, 5G is targeted to reach latency of 1 ms or less. This reduction in latency boosts wireless throughput by a factor of 10.
