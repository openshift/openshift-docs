Quickly create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using a Terraform cluster template that is configured with the default cluster options.

[NOTE]

* For a quickstart guide for ROSA, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html-single/getting_started/#rosa-quickstart-guide-ui[{product-title} quickstart guide].
* To install ROSA clusters with the default options by using the CLI or {cluster-manager-url}, see xref:rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly-ocm_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-quickly[Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using the default options].
* For steps to deploy a ROSA cluster by using `manual` mode or with customizations, see xref:rosa-sts-creating-cluster-using-customizations_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[Creating a ROSA cluster with STS using customizations].

The cluster creation process described below uses a Terraform configuration that prepares a ROSA Classic AWS Security Token Service (STS) cluster with the following resources:

* An OIDC provider with a managed `oidc-config`
* Prerequisite Operator roles with policies
* IAM account roles with policies
* All other AWS resources required to create a ROSA with STS cluster
