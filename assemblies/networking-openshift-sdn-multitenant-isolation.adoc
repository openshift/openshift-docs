When your cluster is configured to use the multitenant isolation mode for the
OpenShift SDN network plugin, each project is isolated by default. Network traffic
is not allowed between pods or services in different projects in multitenant
isolation mode.

You can change the behavior of multitenant isolation for a project in two ways:

* You can join one or more projects, allowing network traffic between pods and
services in different projects.

* You can disable network isolation for a project. It will be globally
accessible, accepting network traffic from pods and services in all other
projects. A globally accessible project can access pods and services in all
other projects.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a cluster configured to use the OpenShift SDN network plugin in multitenant isolation mode.
