Triggers, also known as scalers, provide the metrics that the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator uses to scale your pods.

The custom metrics autoscaler currently supports only the Prometheus, CPU, memory, and Apache Kafka triggers.

You use a `ScaledObject` or `ScaledJob` custom resource to configure triggers for specific objects, as described in the sections that follow.
