= Viewing cluster notifications using the {hybrid-console}

Cluster notifications provide important information about the health of your cluster. You can view notifications that have been sent to your cluster in the **Cluster history** tab on the {hybrid-console}.

.Prerequisites
* You are logged in to the {hybrid-console-second}.

.Procedure
. Navigate to the link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[Clusters] page of the {hybrid-console-second}.
. Click the name of your cluster to go to the cluster details page.
. Click the **Cluster history** tab.
+
Cluster notifications appear under the Cluster history heading.
. Optional: Filter for relevant cluster notifications
+
Use the filter controls to hide cluster notifications that are not relevant to you, so that you can focus on your area of expertise or on resolving a critical issue. You can filter notifications based on text in the notification description, severity level, notification type, when the notification was received, and which system or person triggered the notification.
