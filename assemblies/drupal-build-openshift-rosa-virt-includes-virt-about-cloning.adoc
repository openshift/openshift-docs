= About cloning

When cloning a data volume, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) chooses one of the following Container Storage Interface (CSI) clone methods:

* CSI volume cloning
* Smart cloning

Both CSI volume cloning and smart cloning methods are efficient, but they have certain requirements for use. If the requirements are not met, the CDI uses host-assisted cloning. Host-assisted cloning is the slowest and least efficient method of cloning, but it has fewer requirements than either of the other two cloning methods.

== CSI volume cloning

Container Storage Interface (CSI) cloning uses CSI driver features to more efficiently clone a source data volume.

CSI volume cloning has the following requirements:

* The CSI driver that backs the storage class of the persistent volume claim (PVC) must support volume cloning.
* For provisioners not recognized by the CDI, the corresponding storage profile must have the `cloneStrategy` set to CSI Volume Cloning.
* The source and target PVCs must have the same storage class and volume mode.
* If you create the data volume, you must have permission to create the `datavolumes/source` resource in the source namespace.
* The source volume must not be in use.


[id="smart-cloning_{context}"]
== Smart cloning

When a Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugin with snapshot capabilities is available, the Containerized Data Importer (CDI) creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) from a snapshot, which then allows efficient cloning of additional PVCs.

Smart cloning has the following requirements:

* A snapshot class associated with the storage class must exist.
* The source and target PVCs must have the same storage class and volume mode.
* If you create the data volume, you must have permission to create the `datavolumes/source` resource in the source namespace.
* The source volume must not be in use.


[id="host-assisted-cloning_{context}"]
== Host-assisted cloning

When the requirements for neither Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume cloning nor smart cloning have been met, host-assisted cloning is used as a fallback method. Host-assisted cloning is less efficient than either of the two other cloning methods.

Host-assisted cloning uses a source pod and a target pod to copy data from the source volume to the target volume. The target persistent volume claim (PVC) is annotated with the fallback reason that explains why host-assisted cloning has been used, and an event is created.
