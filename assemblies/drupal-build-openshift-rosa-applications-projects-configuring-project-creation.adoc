In {product-title}, _projects_ are used to group and isolate related objects.
When a request is made to create a new project using the web console or `oc
new-project` command, an endpoint in {product-title} is used to provision the
project according to a template, which can be customized.

As
a cluster administrator, you can allow and configure how developers and service
accounts can create, or _self-provision_, their own projects.
