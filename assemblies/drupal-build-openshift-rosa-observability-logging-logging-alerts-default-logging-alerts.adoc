Logging alerts are installed as part of the {clo} installation. Alerts depend on metrics exported by the log collection and log storage backends. These metrics are enabled if you selected the option to *Enable operator recommended cluster monitoring on this namespace* when installing the {clo}. For more information about installing logging Operators, see xref:../../../observability/logging/cluster-logging-deploying#cluster-logging-deploy-console_cluster-logging-deploying[Installing {logging} using the web console].

Default logging alerts are sent to the {product-title} monitoring stack Alertmanager in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace, unless you have disabled the local Alertmanager instance.
