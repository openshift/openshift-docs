= Adding an add-on service to a cluster

You can add an add-on service to an existing {product-title}
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
(ROSA)
endif::openshift-rosa[]
cluster by using {cluster-manager-first}.

.Prerequisites

* You have created and provisioned a cluster for {product-title}.
* Your cluster meets all of the prerequisites for the service that you want to add on to your cluster.
* For paid add-on services, note the following considerations:
** If the organization has sufficient quota, and if the service is compatible with the cluster, the service appears in {cluster-manager}.
** If the organization has never had quota, or if the cluster is not compatible, then the service does not display.
** If the organization had quota in the past, but the quota is currently `0`, the service is still visible but disabled in {cluster-manager} until you get more quota.

// TODO: Could this just be one of the above prereqs instead of its own NOTE?
