= Advisor recommendation filters

The Insights advisor service can return a large number of recommendations. To focus on your most critical recommendations, you can apply filters to the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/insights/advisor/recommendations[Advisor recommendations] list to remove low-priority recommendations.

By default, filters are set to only show enabled recommendations that are impacting one or more clusters. To view all or disabled recommendations in the Insights library, you can customize the filters.

To apply a filter, select a filter type and then set its value based on the options that are available in the drop-down list. You can apply multiple filters to the list of recommendations.

You can set the following filter types:

* *Name:* Search for a recommendation by name.
* *Total risk:* Select one or more values from *Critical*, *Important*, *Moderate*, and *Low* indicating the likelihood and the severity of a negative impact on a cluster.
* *Impact:* Select one or more values from *Critical*, *High*, *Medium*, and *Low* indicating the potential impact to the continuity of cluster operations. 
* *Likelihood:* Select one or more values from *Critical*, *High*, *Medium*, and *Low* indicating the potential for a negative impact to a cluster if the recommendation comes to fruition.
* *Category:* Select one or more categories from *Service Availability*, *Performance*, *Fault Tolerance*, *Security*, and *Best Practice* to focus your attention on.
* *Status:* Click a radio button to show enabled recommendations (default), disabled recommendations, or all recommendations.
* *Clusters impacted:* Set the filter to show recommendations currently impacting one or more clusters, non-impacting recommendations, or all recommendations.
* *Risk of change:* Select one or more values from *High*, *Moderate*, *Low*, and *Very low* indicating the risk that the implementation of the resolution could have on cluster operations.
