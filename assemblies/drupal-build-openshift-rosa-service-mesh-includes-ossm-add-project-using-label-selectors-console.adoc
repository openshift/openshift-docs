= Adding a project to the mesh using label selectors with the web console

You can use labels selectors to add a project to the {SMProductShortName} with the {product-title} web console.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the {SMProductName} Operator.
* The deployment has an existing `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource.
ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as `cluster-admin`.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
ifdef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
endif::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]

.Procedure

. Navigate to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators*.

. Click the *Project* menu, and from the drop-down list, select the project where your `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` resource is deployed. For example, *istio-system*.

. Click the {SMProductName} Operator.

. Click the *Istio Service Mesh Member Roll* tab.

. Click *Create ServiceMeshMember Roll*.

. Accept the default name for the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`.

. In the *Labels* field, enter key-value pairs to define the labels that identify which namespaces to include in the service mesh. If a project namespace has either label specified by the selectors, then the project namespace is included in the service mesh. You do not need to include both labels.
+
For example, entering `mykey=myvalue` includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.
+
Entering `myotherkey=myothervalue` includes all namespaces with this label as part of the mesh. When the selector identifies a match, the project namespace is added to the service mesh.

. Click *Create*.
