= Accessing the Kiali console

You can view your application's topology, health, and metrics in the Kiali console. If your service is experiencing problems, the Kiali console lets you view the data flow through your service. You can view insights about the mesh components at different levels, including abstract applications, services, and workloads. Kiali also provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time.

To access the Kiali console you must have {SMProductName} installed, Kiali installed and configured.

The installation process creates a route to access the Kiali console.

If you know the URL for the Kiali console, you can access it directly.  If you do not know the URL, use the following directions.

.Procedure for administrators
