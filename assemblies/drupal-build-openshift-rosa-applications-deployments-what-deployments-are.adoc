The `Deployment` and `DeploymentConfig` API objects in {product-title} provide two similar but different methods for fine-grained management over common user applications. They are composed of the following separate API objects:

* A `Deployment` or `DeploymentConfig` object, either of which describes the desired state of a particular component of the application as a pod template.
* `Deployment` objects involve one or more _replica sets_, which contain a point-in-time record of the state of a deployment as a pod template. Similarly, `DeploymentConfig` objects involve one or more _replication controllers_, which preceded replica sets.
* One or more pods, which represent an instance of a particular version of an application.

Use `Deployment` objects unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by `DeploymentConfig` objects.

== Building blocks of a deployment

Deployments and deployment configs are enabled by the use of native Kubernetes API objects `ReplicaSet` and `ReplicationController`, respectively, as their building blocks.

Users do not have to manipulate replica sets, replication controllers, or pods owned by `Deployment` or `DeploymentConfig` objects. The deployment systems ensure changes are propagated appropriately.

[TIP]
====
If the existing deployment strategies are not suited for your use case and you must run manual steps during the lifecycle of your deployment, then you should consider creating a custom deployment strategy.
