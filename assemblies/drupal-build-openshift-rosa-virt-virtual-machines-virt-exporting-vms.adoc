You can export a virtual machine (VM) and its associated disks in order to import a VM into another cluster or to analyze the volume for forensic purposes.

You create a `VirtualMachineExport` custom resource (CR) by using the command line interface.

Alternatively, you can use the xref:vm-volume-export-commands_virt-using-the-cli-tools[`virtctl vmexport` command] to create a `VirtualMachineExport` CR and to download exported volumes.

[NOTE]
====
You can migrate virtual machines between OpenShift Virtualization clusters by using the link:https://access.redhat.com/products/migration-toolkits-virtualization[Migration Toolkit for Virtualization].
