{hcp-title-first} offers a reduced-cost solution to create a managed ROSA cluster with a focus on efficiency. You can quickly create a new cluster and deploy applications in minutes.

== Key features of {hcp-title}

* {hcp-title} requires a minimum of only two nodes, making it ideal for smaller projects while still being able to scale to support larger projects and enterprises.

* The underlying control plane infrastructure is fully managed. Control plane components, such as the API server and etcd database, are hosted in a Red Hat-owned AWS account.

* Provisioning time is approximately 10 minutes.

* Customers can upgrade the control plane and machine pools separately, which means they do not have to shut down the entire cluster during upgrades.
