{product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. It also removes the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images from its payload:

* {product-title} 4.11 moves the OpenShift Jenkins and OpenShift Agent Base images to the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io` so that Red Hat can produce and update the images outside the {product-title} lifecycle. Previously, these images were in the {product-title} install payload and the `openshift4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`.

* {product-title} 4.10 deprecated the OpenShift Jenkins Maven and NodeJS Agent images. {product-title} 4.11 removes these images from its payload. Red Hat no longer produces these images, and they are not available from the `ocp-tools-4` repository at `registry.redhat.io`. Red Hat maintains the 4.10 and earlier versions of these images for any significant bug fixes or security CVEs, following the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[{product-title} lifecycle policy].

These changes support the {product-title} 4.10 recommendation to use xref:images-other-jenkins-config-kubernetes_images-other-jenkins[multiple container Pod Templates with the Jenkins Kubernetes Plugin].
