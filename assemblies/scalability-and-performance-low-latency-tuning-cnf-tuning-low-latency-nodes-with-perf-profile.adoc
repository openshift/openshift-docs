= Tuning nodes for low latency with the performance profile
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: cnf-low-latency-perf-profile

toc::[]

Tune nodes for low latency by using the cluster performance profile.
You can restrict CPUs for infra and application containers, configure huge pages, Hyper-Threading, and configure CPU partitions for latency-sensitive processes.

== Reducing NIC queues using the Node Tuning Operator

The Node Tuning Operator facilitates reducing NIC queues for enhanced performance.
Adjustments are made using the performance profile, allowing customization of queues for different network devices.
