Quickly create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using a Terraform cluster template that is configured with the default cluster options.

[NOTE]

The cluster creation process described below uses a Terraform configuration that prepares a ROSA Classic AWS Security Token Service (STS) cluster with the following resources:

* An OIDC provider with a managed `oidc-config`
* Prerequisite Operator roles with policies
* IAM account roles with policies
* All other AWS resources required to create a ROSA with STS cluster
