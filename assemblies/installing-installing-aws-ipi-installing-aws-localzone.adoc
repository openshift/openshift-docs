toc::[]

You can quickly install an {product-title} cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) {zone-type} by setting the zone names in the edge compute pool of the `install-config.yaml` file, or install a cluster in an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with Local Zone subnets.

AWS {zone-type} is an infrastructure that place Cloud Resources close to metropolitan regions. For more information, see the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-local-zones[AWS Local Zones Documentation].

// Infrastructure prerequisites
[id="aws-zones-prerequisites_{context}"]
== Infrastructure prerequisites

* You reviewed details about xref:../../../architecture/architecture-installation.adoc#architecture-installation[{product-title} installation and update] processes.
* You are familiar with xref:../../../installing/installing-preparing.adoc#installing-preparing[Selecting a cluster installation method and preparing it for users].
* You xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.adoc#installing-aws-account[configured an AWS account] to host the cluster.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have an AWS profile stored on your computer, it must not use a temporary session token that you generated while using a multi-factor authentication device. The cluster continues to use your current AWS credentials to create AWS resources for the entire life of the cluster, so you must use key-based, long-term credentials. To generate appropriate keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing Access Keys for IAM Users] in the AWS documentation. You can supply the keys when you run the installation program.
====
* You downloaded the AWS CLI and installed it on your computer. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-bundle.html[Install the AWS CLI Using the Bundled Installer (Linux, macOS, or UNIX)] in the AWS documentation.
* If you use a firewall, you xref:../../../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[configured it to allow the sites] that your cluster must access.
* You noted the region and supported link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/locations[AWS Local Zones locations] to create the network resources in.
* You read the link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/features/[AWS Local Zones features] in the AWS documentation.
* You added permissions for creating network resources that support AWS Local Zones to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role. The following example enables a zone group that can provide a user or role access for creating network network resources that support AWS {zone-type}.

== Installing a cluster in an existing VPC that has Local Zone subnets

You can install a cluster into an existing Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The installation program provisions the rest of the required infrastructure, which you can further customize. To customize the installation, modify parameters in the `install-config.yaml` file before you install the cluster.

Installing a cluster on AWS into an existing VPC requires extending compute nodes to the edge of the Cloud Infrastructure by using AWS {zone-type}.

Local Zone subnets extend regular compute nodes to edge networks. Each edge compute nodes runs a user workload. After you create an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Local Zone environment, and you deploy your cluster, you can use edge compute nodes to create user workloads in Local Zone subnets.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to create private subnets, you must either modify the provided CloudFormation template or create your own template.
====

You can use a provided CloudFormation template to create network resources. Additionally, you can modify a template to customize your infrastructure or use the information that they contain to create AWS resources according to your company's policies.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The steps for performing an installer-provisioned infrastructure installation are provided for example purposes only. Installing a cluster in an existing VPC requires that you have knowledge of the cloud provider and the installation process of {product-title}. You can use a CloudFormation template to assist you with completing these steps or to help model your own cluster installation. Instead of using the CloudFormation template to create resources, you can decide to use other methods for generating these resources.
