= Using volumes to persist container data
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]





Files in a container are ephemeral. As such, when a container crashes or stops, the data is lost.
You can use _volumes_ to persist the data used by the containers in a pod. A volume is directory, accessible to the Containers in a pod, where data is stored for the life of the pod.
