toc::[]

The OVN-Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin is the default networking solution for {microshift-short} clusters. OVN-Kubernetes is a virtualized network for pods and services that is based on Open Virtual Network (OVN).

* Default network configuration and connections are applied automatically in {microshift-short} with the `microshift-networking` RPM during installation.
* A cluster that uses the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin also runs Open vSwitch (OVS) on the node.
* OVN-K configures OVS on the node to implement the declared network configuration.
* Host physical interfaces are not bound by default to the OVN-K gateway bridge, `br-ex`. You can use standard tools on the host for managing the default gateway, such as the Network Manager CLI (`nmcli`).
* Changing the CNI is not supported on {microshift-short}.

Using configuration files or custom scripts, you can configure the following networking settings:

* You can use subnet CIDR ranges to allocate IP addresses to pods.
* You can change the maximum transmission unit (MTU) value.
* You can configure firewall ingress and egress.
* You can define network policies in the {microshift-short} cluster, including ingress and egress rules.
* You can use the {microshift-short} Multus plug-in to chain other CNI plugins.
* You can configure or remove the ingress router.

[id="microshift-network-features_{context}"]
== Network features
Networking features available with {microshift-short} {product-version} include:

* Kubernetes network policy
* Dynamic node IP
* Custom gateway interface
* Second gateway interface
* Cluster network on specified host interface
* Blocking external access to NodePort service on specific host interfaces

Networking features not available with {microshift-short} {product-version}:

* Egress IP/firewall/QoS: disabled
* Hybrid networking: not supported
* IPsec: not supported
* Hardware offload: not supported

[id="microshift-ip-forward_{context}"]
== IP forward
The host network `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward` kernel parameter is automatically enabled by the `ovnkube-master` container when started. This is required to forward incoming traffic to the CNI. For example, accessing the NodePort service from outside of a cluster fails if `ip_forward` is disabled.

[id="microshift-network-performance_{context}"]
== Network performance optimizations
By default, three performance optimizations are applied to OVS services to minimize resource consumption:

* CPU affinity to `ovs-vswitchd.service` and `ovsdb-server.service`
* `no-mlockall` to `openvswitch.service`
* Limit handler and `revalidator` threads to `ovs-vswitchd.service`

[id="microshift-bridge-mapping_{context}"]
== Bridge mappings
Bridge mappings allow provider network traffic to reach the physical network. Traffic leaves the provider network and arrives at the `br-int` bridge. A patch port between `br-int` and `br-ex` then allows the traffic to traverse to and from the provider network and the edge network. Kubernetes pods are connected to the `br-int` bridge through virtual ethernet pair: one end of the virtual ethernet pair is attached to the pod namespace, and the other end is attached to the `br-int` bridge.
