= Scorecard configuration

The scorecard tool uses a configuration that allows you to configure internal plugins, as well as several global configuration options. Tests are driven by a configuration file named `config.yaml`, which is generated by the `make bundle` command, located in your `bundle/` directory:

[source,terminal]
----
./bundle
...
└── tests
    └── scorecard
        └── config.yaml
