= Including pod priority in pod scheduling decisions
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]



You can enable pod priority and preemption in your cluster. Pod priority indicates the importance of a pod relative to other pods and queues the pods based on that priority. pod preemption allows the cluster to evict, or preempt, lower-priority pods so that higher-priority pods can be scheduled if there is no available space on a suitable node
pod priority also affects the scheduling order of pods and out-of-resource eviction ordering on the node.

ifndef::openshift-rosa,openshift-dedicated[]
To use priority and preemption, you create priority classes that define the relative weight of your pods. Then, reference a priority class in the pod specification to apply that weight for scheduling.
