= Updating Logging


There are two types of {logging} updates: minor release updates (5.y.z) and major release updates (5.y).

== Minor release updates

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Automatic* update approval option, your Operators receive minor version updates automatically. You do not need to complete any manual update steps.

If you installed the {logging} Operators using the *Manual* update approval option, you must manually approve minor version updates.
