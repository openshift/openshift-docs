[id="rosa-sts-cluster-terraform-setup_{context}"]
= Preparing your environment for Terraform

Before you can create your {product-title} cluster by using Terraform, you need to export your link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[offline {cluster-manager-first} token].

.Procedure
. *Optional*: Because the Terraform files get created in your current directory during this procedure, you can create a new directory to store these files and navigate into it by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir terraform-cluster && cd terraform-cluster
----

. Grant permissions to your account by using link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[an offline {cluster-manager-first} token].

. Copy your offline token, and set the token as an environmental variable by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export RHCS_TOKEN=<your_offline_token>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This environmental variable resets at the end of each session, such as restarting your machine or closing the terminal.
====

.Verification

* After you export your token, verify the value by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ echo $RHCS_TOKEN
----
