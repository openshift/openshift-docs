Create a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster quickly by using the default options and automatic AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resource creation. You can deploy your cluster by using {cluster-manager-first} or the ROSA CLI (`rosa`).

The procedures in this document use the `auto` modes in the ROSA CLI (`rosa`) and {cluster-manager} to immediately create the required IAM resources using the current AWS account. The required resources include the account-wide IAM roles and policies, cluster-specific Operator roles and policies, and OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider.

Alternatively, you can use `manual` mode, which outputs the `aws` commands needed to create the IAM resources instead of deploying them automatically. For steps to deploy a ROSA cluster by using `manual` mode or with customizations, see xref:../rosa_install_access_delete_clusters/rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations.adoc#rosa-sts-creating-cluster-using-customizations_rosa-sts-creating-a-cluster-with-customizations[Creating a cluster using customizations].
