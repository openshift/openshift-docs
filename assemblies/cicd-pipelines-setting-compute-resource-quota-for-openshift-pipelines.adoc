A `ResourceQuota` object in {pipelines-title} controls the total resource consumption per namespace. You can use it to limit the quantity of objects created in a namespace, based on the type of the object. In addition, you can specify a compute resource quota to restrict the total amount of compute resources consumed in a namespace.

However, you might want to limit the amount of compute resources consumed by pods resulting from a pipeline run, rather than setting quotas for the entire namespace. Currently, {pipelines-title} does not enable you to directly specify the compute resource quota for a pipeline.

[NOTE]
====
When using {pipelines-title} in a namespace configured with a `ResourceQuota` object, the pods resulting from task runs and pipeline runs might fail with an error, such as: `failed quota: <quota name> must specify cpu, memory`.

To avoid this error, do any one of the following:

* (Recommended) Specify a limit range for the namespace.
* Explicitly define requests and limits for all containers.

For more information, refer to the link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SRVKP-1801[issue] and the link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2841971[resolution].
====

If your use case is not addressed by these approaches, you can implement a workaround by using a resource quota for a priority class.
