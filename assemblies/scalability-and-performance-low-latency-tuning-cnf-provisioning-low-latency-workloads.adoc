toc::[]

Many organizations need high performance computing and low, predictable latency, especially in the financial and telecommunications industries.

{product-title} provides the Node Tuning Operator to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance and consistent response time for {product-title} applications.
You use the performance profile configuration to make these changes.
You can update the kernel to kernel-rt, reserve CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, isolate CPUs for application containers to run the workloads, and disable unused CPUs to reduce power consumption.

[NOTE]
====
When writing your applications, follow the general recommendations described in link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_for_real_time/9/html-single/understanding_rhel_for_real_time/index#assembly_rhel-for-real-time-processes-and-threads_understanding-RHEL-for-Real-Time-core-concepts[RHEL for Real Time processes and threads].
