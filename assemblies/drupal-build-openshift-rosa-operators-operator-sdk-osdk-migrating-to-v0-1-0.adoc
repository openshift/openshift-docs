This guide describes how to migrate an Operator project built using Operator SDK v0.0.x to the project structure required by link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/releases[Operator SDK v0.1.0].

The recommended method for migrating your project is to:

. Initialize a new v0.1.0 project.
. Copy your code into the new project.
. Modify the new project as described for v0.1.0.

This guide uses the `memcached-operator`, the example project from xref:osdk-about[the Operator SDK], to illustrate the migration steps. See the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk-samples/tree/aa15bd278eec0959595e0a0a7282a26055d7f9d6/memcached-operator[v0.0.7 memcached-operator] and link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk-samples/tree/4c6934448684a6953ece4d3d9f3f77494b1c125e/memcached-operator[v0.1.0 memcached-operator] project structures for pre- and post-migration examples, respectively.
