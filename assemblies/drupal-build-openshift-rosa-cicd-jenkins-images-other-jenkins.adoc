{product-title} provides a container image for running Jenkins. This image provides a Jenkins server instance, which can be used to set up a basic flow for continuous testing, integration, and delivery.

The image is based on the Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI).

{product-title} follows the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[LTS] release of Jenkins. {product-title} provides an image that contains Jenkins 2.x.

The {product-title} Jenkins images are available on link:https://quay.io[Quay.io] or link:https://registry.redhat.io[registry.redhat.io].

For example:

[source,terminal]
----
$ podman pull registry.redhat.io/ocp-tools-4/jenkins-rhel8:<image_tag>
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these registries or push them into your {product-title} container image registry. Additionally, you can create an image stream that points to the image, either in your container image registry or at the external location. Your {product-title} resources can then reference the image stream.

But for convenience, {product-title} provides image streams in the `openshift` namespace for the core Jenkins image as well as the example Agent images provided for {product-title} integration with Jenkins.

== Jenkins cross volume mount points

The Jenkins image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the configuration:

* `/var/lib/jenkins` is the data directory where Jenkins stores configuration files, including job definitions.
