= Managing objects with the ROSA CLI

:context: rosa-managing-objects-cli


Managing objects with the {product-title} (ROSA) CLI, `rosa`, such as adding `dedicated-admin` users, managing clusters, and scheduling cluster upgrades.

[NOTE]
====	
To access a cluster that is accessible only over an HTTP proxy server, you can set the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` variables. These environment variables are respected by the `rosa` CLI so that all communication with the cluster goes through the HTTP proxy.
