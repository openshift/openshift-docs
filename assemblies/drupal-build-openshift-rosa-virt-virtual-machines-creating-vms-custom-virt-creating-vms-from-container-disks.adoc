You can create virtual machines (VMs) by using container disks built from operating system images.

You can enable auto updates for your container disks. See xref:virt-automatic-bootsource-updates[Managing automatic boot source updates] for details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the container disks are large, the I/O traffic might increase and cause worker nodes to be unavailable. You can perform the following tasks to resolve this issue:

* xref:../../../applications/pruning-objects.adoc#pruning-deployments_pruning-objects[Pruning `DeploymentConfig` objects].
* xref:../../../nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-garbage-collection.adoc#nodes-nodes-garbage-collection-configuring_nodes-nodes-configuring[Configuring garbage collection].

You create a VM from a container disk by performing the following steps:

. xref:virt-preparing-container-disk-for-vms_virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[Build an operating system image into a container disk and upload it to your container registry].
. If your container registry does not have TLS, xref:virt-disabling-tls-for-registry_virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[configure your environment to disable TLS for your registry].
. Create a VM with the container disk as the disk source by using the xref:virt-creating-vm-custom-image-web_virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[web console] or the xref:virt-creating-vm-import-cli_virt-creating-vms-from-container-disks[command line].

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must install the xref:virt-installing-qemu-guest-agent[QEMU guest agent] on VMs created from operating system images that are not provided by Red Hat.
