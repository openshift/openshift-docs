= Setting scrape sample and label limits for user-defined projects

You can limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects. You can also limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values.

[WARNING]
====
If you set sample or label limits, no further sample data is ingested for that target scrape after the limit is reached.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role, or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
* A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* The `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object exists. This object is created by default when the cluster is created.
endif::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

. Add the `enforcedSampleLimit` configuration to `data/config.yaml` to limit the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedSampleLimit: 50000 <1>
----
<1> A value is required if this parameter is specified. This `enforcedSampleLimit` example limits the number of samples that can be accepted per target scrape in user-defined projects to 50,000.

. Add the `enforcedLabelLimit`, `enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit`, and `enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit` configurations to `data/config.yaml` to limit the number of scraped labels, the length of label names, and the length of label values in user-defined projects:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheus:
      enforcedLabelLimit: 500 <1>
      enforcedLabelNameLengthLimit: 50 <2>
      enforcedLabelValueLengthLimit: 600 <3>
----
<1> Specifies the maximum number of labels per scrape.
The default value is `0`, which specifies no limit.
<2> Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label name.
The default value is `0`, which specifies no limit.
<3> Specifies the maximum length in characters of a label value.
The default value is `0`, which specifies no limit.

. Save the file to apply the changes. The limits are applied automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object, the pods and other resources in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
