Network verification checks run automatically when you deploy

an {product-title}

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
a {product-title} (ROSA)
endif::openshift-rosa[]
cluster into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or create an additional machine pool with a subnet that is new to your cluster. The checks validate your network configuration and highlight errors, enabling you to resolve configuration issues prior to deployment.

You can also run the network verification checks manually to validate the configuration for an existing cluster.
