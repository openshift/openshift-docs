[id="sd-terraform-cluster-destroy_{context}"]
= Deleting your ROSA cluster with Terraform

Use the `terraform destroy` command to remove all of the resources that were created with the `terraform apply` command.

[NOTE]
====
Do not modify your Terraform `.tf` files
ifndef::tf-defaults[]
or the `terraform.tfvars` file
endif::tf-defaults[]
before destroying your resources. These variables are matched to resources to delete.
====

.Procedure
. In the directory where you ran the `terraform apply` command to create your cluster, run the following command to delete the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ terraform destroy
----
ifndef::tf-defaults[]
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
After you enter the name of the ROSA cluster and confirm destruction by entering `yes`, you cannot stop the `terraform destroy` process. Your account, Operator roles, and cluster are deleted.
====

. Enter the name of the cluster that you want to delete:
+
[source,terminal]
----
var.cluster_name
  Provide the name of your ROSA cluster.

  Enter a value: <name_of_rosa_cluster> <1>
----
--
<1> A valid value is the name of the ROSA cluster you want to delete.
--
endif::tf-defaults[]

. Enter `yes` to start the role and cluster deletion:

.Example output of Terraform confirmation:
[source,terminal]
----
Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 39 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes
----

.Verification
. Verify that your cluster was destroyed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list clusters
----
+
.Example output showing no cluster
[source,terminal]
----
I: No clusters available
----

. Verify that the account roles were destroyed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list account-roles
----
+
.Example output showing no Terraform-created account roles:
[source,terminal]
----
I: Fetching account roles
I: No account roles available
----

. Verify that the Operator roles were destroyed by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rosa list operator-roles
----
+
.Example output showing no Terraform-created Operator roles:
[source,terminal]
----
I: Fetching operator roles
