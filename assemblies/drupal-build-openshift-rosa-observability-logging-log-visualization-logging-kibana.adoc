= Log visualization with Kibana
:context: logging-kibana


If you are using the ElasticSearch log store, you can use the Kibana console to visualize collected log data.

Using Kibana, you can do the following with your data:

* Search and browse the data using the *Discover* tab.
* Chart and map the data using the *Visualize* tab.
* Create and view custom dashboards using the *Dashboard* tab.

Use and configuration of the Kibana interface is beyond the scope of this documentation. For more information about using the interface, see the link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.8/connect-to-elasticsearch.html[Kibana documentation].

[NOTE]
====
The audit logs are not stored in the internal {product-title} Elasticsearch instance by default. To view the audit logs in Kibana, you must use the xref:cluster-logging-elasticsearch-audit_logging-config-es-store[Log Forwarding API] to configure a pipeline that uses the `default` output for audit logs.
