= Allowing containers to consume API objects
include::../includes/common-attributes.adoc[]






The _Downward API_ is a mechanism that allows containers to consume information
about API objects without coupling to {product-title}.
Such information includes the pod's name, namespace, and resource values.
Containers can consume information from the downward API using environment
variables or a volume plugin.
