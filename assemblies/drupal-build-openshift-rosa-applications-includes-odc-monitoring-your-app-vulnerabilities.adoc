= Monitoring your application and image vulnerabilities metrics

After you create applications in your project and deploy them, use the *Developer* perspective in the web console to see the metrics for your application dependency vulnerabilities across your cluster. The metrics help you to analyze the following image vulnerabilities in detail:

* Total count of vulnerable images in a selected project
* Severity-based counts of all vulnerable images in a selected project
* Drilldown into severity to obtain the details, such as count of vulnerabilities, count of fixable vulnerabilities, and number of affected pods for each vulnerable image

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the Red Hat Quay Container Security operator from the Operator Hub.
+
[NOTE]
====
The Red Hat Quay Container Security operator detects vulnerabilities by scanning the images that are in the quay registry.
====

.Procedure

. For a general overview of the image vulnerabilities, on the navigation panel of the *Developer* perspective, click *Project* to see the project dashboard.

. Click *Image Vulnerabilities* in the *Status* section. The window that opens displays details such as *Vulnerable Container Images* and *Fixable Container Images*.

. For a detailed vulnerabilities overview, click the *Vulnerabilities* tab on the project dashboard.

.. To get more detail about an image, click its name.

.. View the default graph with all types of vulnerabilities in the *Details* tab.

.. Optional: Click the toggle button to view a specific type of vulnerability. For example, clickÂ *App dependency* to see vulnerabilities specific to application dependency.

.. Optional: You can filter the list of vulnerabilities based on their *Severity* and *Type* or sort them by *Severity*, *Package*, *Type*, *Source*, *Current Version*, and *Fixed in Version*.

.. Click a *Vulnerability* to get its associated details:
+
* *Base image* vulnerabilities display information from a Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA).
* *App dependency* vulnerabilities display information from the Snyk security application.
