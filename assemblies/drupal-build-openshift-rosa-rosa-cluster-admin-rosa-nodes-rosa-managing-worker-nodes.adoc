= Managing compute nodes
:context: rosa-managing-worker-nodes

This document describes how to manage compute (also known as worker) nodes with {product-title} (ROSA).

The majority of changes for compute nodes are configured on machine pools. A machine pool is a group of compute nodes in a cluster that have the same configuration, providing ease of management.

You can edit machine pool configuration options such as scaling, adding node labels, and adding taints.
