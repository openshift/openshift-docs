== Using the Registry

. Launch the registry in a web browser. Depending on the configuration you may
see images you have access to.
. Create a project. This is a namespace and will be part of the image name in
the form of *<registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>*. You will be the administrator of projects you create.

[NOTE]
====
There are several configuration options for {product-title}. Your administrator
may have disabled project self-provisioning. Sharing images may also be disabled.
In this configuration you may only be able to pull existing images.
====

=== Docker Commands

Images are pushed and pulled from the docker command line. The docker command
line reference is found on the bottom of the web interface overview page.

. {product-title} uses a token as a password for docker login. Copy the *docker
login* command from the web interface and paste it into a terminal window.
+
----
$ sudo docker login -p <token> -u unused -e unused <hostname>:5000
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Your username and password credentials are not valid when logging in with Docker
CLI. Use the token for the password argument.
====
+
. Tag an image. Here we tag a *centos* base image into the registry using the
project name we created above.
+
----
$ sudo docker tag centos <registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>
----
+
. Push the image to the registry.
+
----
$ sudo docker push <registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>
----

=== Docker Login Sessions

{product-title} uses a session token for the Docker login command. With the
default configuration this token will expire within 24 hours. Contact the
{product-title} administrator for extending the session timeout.

If a long-lived Docker login is desired use a service account token. This may be
used in place of the Docker login password value:

----
$ sudo docker login -p <service_account_token> -u unused -e unused <hostname>:5000
----

[NOTE]
====
Throughout this document *sudo* is prepended to example *docker* commands.
Depending on your environment *sudo* may not be required. This impacts where the
Docker credentials file is stored. With *sudo*, Docker login credentials are
stored in `/root/.docker/config.json`. Without *sudo*, Docker login credentials are stored in
`~/.docker/config.json`, which will be a different path if not logged in as
*root* user. This would cause docker commands to fail authentication if *sudo*
is used inconsistently.

=== Using Service Account Tokens for Docker Login

For long-lived, token-based authentication, users may create
xref:../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service
account tokens] to authenticate with Docker. This is particularly useful when
integrating automation. Service accounts must be configured using the CLI. See
xref:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.adoc#cli-reference-get-started-cli[Getting
Started with the CLI].

. Create a service account in the current project named *push*.
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount push
----

. Add the registry role to the service account. In this example, we grant the
service account the *registry-editor* role. We are using the *test* project.
+
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user registry-editor system:serviceaccounts:test:push
----

. Describe the service account to display the secret token name.
+
----
$ oc describe sa push
Name:		push
Namespace:	test
Labels:		<none>

Image pull secrets:	push-dockercfg-39j62

Mountable secrets: 	push-token-5518o
                   	push-dockercfg-39j62

Tokens:            	push-token-5518o
                   	push-token-htcxd
----

. Describe the token to get the secret value.
+
----
$ oc describe secret push-token-5518o
Name:		push-token-5518o
Namespace:	test
Labels:		<none>
Annotations:	kubernetes.io/service-account.name=push,kubernetes.io/service-account.uid=9eb24eeb-12d8-11e6-a276-0afb45fc7af5

Type:	kubernetes.io/service-account-token

Data
====
token:		eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
ca.crt:		1066 bytes
namespace:	8 bytes
----

. Copy the token value and use as the value to the *--password* argument in the `docker login`
command. Notice that the values for the username and email arguments are not used, so
they can be any string.
+
----
$ sudo docker login -p eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... -u unused -e unused REGISTRY_URL:5000
----

Service accounts may be deleted, which disables further authentication attempts.
For example, as soon as the service account is deleted, `docker push` will no longer
succeed if logged in with this service account token.

----
$ oc delete serviceaccount push
----
