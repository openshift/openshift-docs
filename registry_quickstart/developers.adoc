== Using the Registry

. Launch the registry in a web browser. Depending on the configuration you may
see images you have access to.
. Create a project. This is a namespace and will be part of the image name in
the form of *<registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>*. You will be the administrator of projects you create.

[NOTE]
====
There are several configuration options for {product-title}. Your administrator
may have disabled project self-provisioning. Sharing images may also be disabled.
In this configuration you may only be able to pull existing images.
====

=== Docker Commands

Images are pushed and pulled from the docker command line. The docker command
line reference is found on the bottom of the web interface overview page.

. {product-title} uses a token as a password for docker login. Copy the *docker
login* command from the web interface and paste it into a terminal window.
+
----
$ sudo docker login -p <token> -u unused -e unused <hostname>:5000
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Your username and password credentials are not valid when logging in with Docker
CLI. Use the token for the password argument.
====
+
. Tag an image. Here we tag a *centos* base image into the registry using the
project name we created above.
+
----
$ sudo docker tag centos <registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>
----
+
. Push the image to the registry.
+
----
$ sudo docker push <registry_hostname>/<project>/<image>
----

=== Docker Login Sessions

{product-title} uses a session token for the Docker login command. With the
default configuration this token will expire within 24 hours. Contact the
{product-title} administrator for extending the session timeout.

If a long-lived Docker login is desired use a service account token. This may be
used in place of the Docker login password value:

----
$ sudo docker login -p <service_account_token> -u unused -e unused <hostname>:5000
----

[NOTE]
====
Throughout this document *sudo* is prepended to example *docker* commands.
Depending on your environment *sudo* may not be required. This impacts where the
Docker credentials file is stored. With *sudo*, Docker login credentials are
stored in `/root/.docker/config.json`. Without *sudo*, Docker login credentials are stored in
`~/.docker/config.json`, which will be a different path if not logged in as
*root* user. This would cause docker commands to fail authentication if *sudo*
is used inconsistently.
