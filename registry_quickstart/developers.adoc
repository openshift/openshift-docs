== Using the Registry

. Launch the registry in a web browser. Depending on the configuration you may see images you have access to.
. Create a project. This is a namespace and will be part of the image name in the form of *<registry_hostname>/<project_name>/<image_name>*. You will be the administrator of projects you create.

=== Docker Commands

Images are pushed and pulled from the docker command line. The docker command line reference is found on the bottom of the web interface overview page.

. Copy the *docker login* command from the web interface and paste it into a terminal window.

$ sudo docker login -p <token> -u unused -e unused <hostname>:5000

. Tag an image. Here we tag a *centos* base image into the registry using the project name we created above.

----
$ sudo docker tag centos <registry_hostname>/<project_name>/<image_name>

. Push the image to the registry.
