== Prerequisites

* Docker
* `atomic` CLI (optional). This is part of any Red Hat-based system, Fedora, Centos, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, including Atomic host variants.
* Storage for images. By default registry images will use local storage at /var/lib/origin/volumes It is recommended that external storage be provided at this mountpoint or configure the registry for cloud storage.

== Deploy the Registry

. **Install**. This will create configuration files and certificates in /etc/origin , create systemd files and pull down the docker images.
+
----
$ sudo atomic install projectatomic/atomic-registry-quickstart
----
+
. **Configure**. Optionally edit configuration file /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml Refer to documentation to configure the authentication identity provider. or customizing certificates. NOTE: Once the registry is running you may load any configuration changes using the systemd service manager, sudo systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master.service
. **Run**. Start the origin service and launch the registry and web UI services.
+
----
$ sudo atomic run projectatomic/atomic-registry-quickstart
----
+
Launch the registry web UI using a browser: link:#[https://SERVER]. By default, any username and password will authenticate and have basic user priviledges.

== Configure

There are several setup steps that should be performed. These steps assume access to the CLI.

=== Working with the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI client is not installed on the host system but it is available by entering the origin-master container on the Atomic Registry host system. The client may be installed on a remote system. See documentation for installing and using the remote CLI client.

----
$ sudo docker exec -it origin-master bash
# oc whoami
system:admin
----

The *system:admin* user is a special user that should only be used for local cluster-administration tasks.

. Configure an identity provider. Edit */etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml* and restart the *atomic-openshift-master* service. Refer to link:#[authentication documentation] for supported identity providers, configuration details and examples. Hint: Integrating with GitHub authentication is a fairly straightforward option.
+
    sudo systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master.service
+
. Create an admin user. All authenticated users are assigned a basic user role by default. Choose at least one user to be an administrator. Replace USERNAME with a real user.
+
    oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin USERNAME
+
. Configure registry storage. TODO
