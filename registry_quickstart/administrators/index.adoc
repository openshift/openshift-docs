== About the Quickstart Installation

The {product-title} quickstart installation has been provided to get a system
running as quickly as possible. Several non-production choices have been made to
enable this installation experience.

* **Single host**. Both **master** and **node** roles are deployed on the same host.
Multi-host configuration is not supported with this deployment method.
* **Non-HA**. It does not deploy a highly available configuration.
* *Install Container*: {product-title} is container-based software. The
quickstart installation is delivered and run using a privileged Docker image. This
container deploys other containers. This custom installation method may not work
on all systems.
* *Container Management*. Effort has been made to standardize the operating environment so
that production and non-production deployments are managed the same way.
{product-title} uses link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/[OpenShift Origin-based]
technology to deploy its services. See the
link:../../architecture/index.html[architecture section] for more details.
* *Node Ports*: The installation uses a
link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#type-nodeport[Kubernetes service feature]
that exposes ports directly on the host. This eliminates dependencies on DNS
configuration but is not a recommended method of exposing a Kubernetes service.
To achieve this, the default node port range has been expanded to include ports
through 443. See the value of *servicesNodePortRange* in configuration file
*/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml*.

== Prerequisites

* A single Linux system with Docker service
* Allow traffic to TCP ports 443, 8443 and 5000. Optionally TCP/80 to redirect web console traffic from http to https
* Storage for images. By default registry images will use local storage at
*/var/lib/origin/volumes*. It is recommended that external storage be provided
at this mount point or configure the registry for object storage.

[NOTE]
====
While {product-title} may run on a non-Red Hat-based distributions, most testing
has been performed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Centos and Fedora, including Atomic Host.
====

=== Recommended

* Hostname with external DNS resolution. An IP address may be used.
* *atomic* CLI version 1.8+. This is part of any Red Hat-based system, Fedora 23+,
Centos 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, including Atomic Host variants. It simplifies
the deployment commands.

== Deploy the Registry

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation will use the system hostname if not provided. If the hostname
does not resolve outside of the system via DNS or the external hostname is
different, use a hostname or external IP address that can be addressed from
outside the system during the install and run steps below.
====

. **Install**. This will create configuration files and certificates in
*/etc/origin* and pull down the docker images.
+
----
$ sudo atomic install projectatomic/atomic-registry-quickstart [hostname_or_IP]
----
+
. **Configure**. Optionally edit configuration file
*/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml*. This is not required and may be
performed after installation.
. **Run**. Start the origin service and launch the registry and web UI services.
+
----
$ sudo atomic run projectatomic/atomic-registry-quickstart [hostname_or_IP]
----
+
. Launch the registry web UI using a browser: link:#[*https://SERVER*]. Unless an
identity provider was configured in step 2 above, **any** username and password will
authenticate and have basic user privileges.
