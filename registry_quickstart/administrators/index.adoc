== About the Quickstart Installation

The {product-title} quickstart installation has been provided to get a system
running as quickly as possible. Several choices have been made to
enable this installation experience.

* **Single host**. All services are deployed on the same host.
Multi-host master and etcd configuration may be achieved but is not provided
by this installation method.
* **Non-HA**. It does not deploy a highly available configuration.
* *Install Container*: {product-title} is container-based software. The
quickstart installation is delivered and run using a privileged, Docker-formatted container image.

=== Prerequisites

* A single Linux system with Docker service and systemd
* Allow traffic to TCP ports 8443, 9090 and 5000.
* Storage for images. By default registry images will use local storage at
*_/var/lib/atomic-registry/registry_*. It is recommended that external storage be provided
at this mount point or configure the registry for object storage.

[NOTE]
====
While {product-title} may run on a non-Red Hat-based distributions, most testing
has been performed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Centos and Fedora, including Atomic Host.
====

==== Recommended

* Hostname with external DNS resolution. An IP address may be used.
* *atomic* CLI version 1.8+. This is part of any Red Hat-based system, Fedora 23+,
Centos 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, including Atomic Host variants. It simplifies
the deployment commands.

== Deploy Registry Services

[IMPORTANT]
====
The installation will use the system hostname if not provided. If the hostname
does not resolve outside of the system via DNS or the external hostname is
different, use a hostname or external IP address that can be addressed from
outside the system during the install and run steps below.
====

. **Install**. This will create and install configuration and service files.
+
----
$ sudo atomic install projectatomic/atomic-registry-install [hostname_or_IP]
----
+
. **Configure**. Optionally edit configuration files
*_/etc/atomic-registry/master/master-config.yaml_* and *_/etc/atomic-registry/registry/config.yml_*.
This is not required and may be performed after installation.
. **Run**. Enable and start the services. This will pull three images and start
three container services managed by systemd. Enabling this service ensures it is
started after a host reboot.
+
----
$ systemctl enable --now atomic-registry-master.service
----
+
. **Setup**. When all three services have been verified to be running, run the
setup script. This creates the oauth client so the web console can connect. It
also configures the registry service account so it can connect to the API master.
This may be run multiple times if run prematurely.
+
----
$ sudo docker ps
$ sudo /var/run/setup-atomic-registry.sh [hostname_or_IP]
----
+
. **Launch**. Using a browser, load the registry console: *https://<hostname>:9090*.
Unless an identity provider was configured in step 2 above, **any username and
password** will authenticate and have basic user privileges.

Until the registry is secured with TLS certificates, configure any docker daemon
clients by editing file *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* to use insecure registry option and
restart the docker service.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
