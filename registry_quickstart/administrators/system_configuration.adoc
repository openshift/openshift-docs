{product-title} deploys container services managed by systemd.

== Logging

Each container service sends logs to the system journal because they are managed
by systemd. For example, here we follow the log from the *atomic-registry-master*
service unit.

----
$ sudo journalctl -flu atomic-registry-master
----

== Configuration

Changes to configuration files require a service restart. Under systemd, use `systemctl`
to manage container lifecycle. Here we restart the atomic-registry-master service.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry-master.service
----

The xref:index.adoc#service-components[three services] may be restarted
independently.

=== Master Configuration

Authentication configuration, project defaults, datastore, API certificates and
other settings are defined globally in a configuration file mounted on the host
at *_/etc/atomic-registry/master/master-config.yaml_*. Whenever this file is
updated restart the *atomic-registry-master* service.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry-master.service
----

Global configuration items managed by this configuration file include:

* xref:../../install_config/configuring_authentication.adoc#install-config-configuring-authentication[Configure authentication]
  by integrating with an identity provider
* Manage xref:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.adoc#admin-guide-managing-projects[project namespace self-provisioning]

Master log level is determined using the service unit configuration file mounted
on the host at *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-registry-master_*.

=== Registry Console Configuration

The registry console is a stateless service that has limited configuration using
environment variables defined in a file mounted on the host at
*_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-registry-console_*.

Configuration changes require a service restart.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry-console.service
----

=== Registry Configuration

The docker distribution registry configuration is managed by a file mounted on
the host at *_/etc/atomic-registry/registry/config.yml_*. See
xref:registry-configuration-reference-sysconfig[registry configuration reference] for complete settings.

Environment variables for this service are managed by a file mounted on the host
at *_/etc/sysconfig/atomic-registry_*.

Configuration changes require a service restart.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry.service
----

[[registry-configuration-reference-sysconfig]]

include::install_config/registry/extended_registry_configuration.adoc[tags=registry-configuration-reference]

== Configuring Certificates

The service endpoints are secured by certificates that are mounted on the host at
*_/etc/atomic-registry/_*. There are separate directories for master and registry certificates.

=== Master

The installer generates self-signed certificates during installation. See
xref:../../install_config/certificate_customization.adoc#install-config-certificate-customization[certificate customization]
for customizing the API master certificates.

=== Registry

Here we create a self-signed certificate so docker clients can connect using
TLS. While other tools like openssl may be used to create certificates, the
master API provides a tool that may also be used.

Execute the following commands from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*:

. Exec into the atomic-registry-master container to access the CLI and change directory
+
----
$ sudo docker exec -it atomic-registry-master bash
$ cd /etc/atomic-registry/master
----
+
. Use the administrator CLI to generate self-signed certificates and exit the
container.
+
====
----
$ oc adm ca create-server-cert \
  --signer-cert=ca.crt \
  --signer-key=ca.key \
  --signer-serial=ca.serial.txt \
  --hostnames='<hostname(s)>' \
  --cert=registry.crt \
  --key=registry.key
$ exit
----
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm ca create-server-cert` command generates a certificate that is valid
for two years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but for
security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than this value.
====
+
. Copy the generated files to the registry directory and change ownership so the
atomic-registry service can read the files.
+
----
$ sudo cp /etc/atomic-registry/master/registry.* /etc/atomic-registry/registry/
$ sudo chown -R 1001:root /etc/atomic-registry/registry/
----
+
. Edit file **/etc/sysconfig/atomic-registry** and uncomment environment
variables `REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE` and `REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY`.
. Restart the *atomic-registry* service to load the configuration changes.
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry.service
----

=== Serving self-signed certificate for docker clients

If you secure the registry using a self-signed certificate key pair you may want
to make the public CA certificate available to users so they don't have to put
docker into insecure mode. The registry master service is able to serve
arbitrary files.

. Edit file *_/etc/atomic-registry/master/master-config.yaml_* and add the
following extension.
+
====
----
    assetConfig:
      ...
      extensions:
        - name: certs
          sourceDirectory: /etc/atomic-registry/master/site
----
====
+
. Copy the certificate to the site subdirectory.
+
----
$ sudo cp /etc/atomic-registry/master/ca.crt /etc/atomic-registry/master/site/
----
+
. Restart the atomic-registry-master service to load the configuration changes.
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry-master.service
----

Registry users may then be instructed to save this cert into their docker client
and restart their docker daemon.

====
----
$ curl --insecure -O https://<registry_hostname>:8443/console/extensions/certs/ca.crt
$ sudo cp ca.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/<registry_hostname>:5000/.
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----
====

== Other Configuration Topics

=== Changing the Session Token length

By default the session token used for `docker login` is 24 hours. This
requires users to run `docker login` every day. This value may be extended in
the master configuration file *_/etc/atomic-registry/master/master-config.yaml_*.
See xref:using-service-account-tokens-for-authentication[below] for using
long-lived service account tokens.

In this example the session token expiration is extended to 30 days.

====
----
tokenConfig:
  accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 2592000
----
====

Restart the atomic-registry-master service to update the running configuration.

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-registry-master.service
----

[[using-service-account-tokens-for-authentication]]
=== Using Service Account Tokens for Authentication

Typically long-lived, token-based authentication is desired. As an alternative
to using user session tokens that expire, users may use
xref:../../admin_guide/service_accounts.adoc#admin-guide-service-accounts[service account tokens] to
authenticate with docker. This is particularly useful when integrating automation.
See the
xref:../developers.adoc#using-service-account-tokens-for-docker-login[quickstart developer guide]
for instructions.

== Data Persistence and Backup

The data that should be persisted is the configuration, image data and the
master database. The required directories are mounted from the container onto
the host. See xref:index.adoc#service-components[Service Components table] for
specific paths.

== CLI

{product-title} provides full control using a command line interface (CLI). To
access the CLI directly on the host you may enter the *atomic-registry-master*
container.

====
----
$ sudo docker exec -it atomic-registry-master bash
# oc whoami
system:admin
# oc projects
Using project "default" on server "https://localhost:8443".
----
====

See xref:../../cli_reference/index.adoc#cli-reference-index[CLI reference] for how to download the
remote CLI client and using the CLI.
