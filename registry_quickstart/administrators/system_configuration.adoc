== Explore the Environment

{product-title} deploys as a Kubernetes-based cluster. The **origin** container
is the primary service that deploys the docker registry and registry console
services.

We can explore these services by entering the base **origin** container and
running some commands.

====
----
$ sudo docker exec -it origin bash
# oc whoami
system:admin
# oc projects
Using project "default" on server "https://172.16.98.26:8443".
# oc get services
NAME               CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                 AGE
docker-registry    172.30.83.71     nodes         5000/TCP                25m
kubernetes         172.30.0.1       <none>        443/TCP,53/UDP,53/TCP   25m
registry-console   172.30.244.124   nodes         9000/TCP                25m
# oc get pods
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

registry-console-2-5utej   1/1       Running   0          5m
----

We can get logs from any pod.

# oc logs registry-console-2-5utej

== Global Configuration Settings

Authentication configuration, project defaults, datastore, API certificates and
other settings are defined globally.

=== Configuration File

{product-title} global system settings are defined in a configuration file
mounted on the host at **/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml**. Whenever this
file is updated changes are read when restarting the **origin** container.

----
$ sudo docker restart origin
----

Global configuration items managed by this configuration file include:

* link:../../install_config/install/configuring_authentication.html[Configure authentication]
  by integrating with an identity provider
* Change the default link:#project-and-image-sharing-modes[project image sharing mode]
* Manage link:../../admin_guide/managing_projects.html[project namespace self-provisioning]

=== CLI Configuration

Some system administration topics are configured using the CLI. See
link:cli.html[CLI getting started] for more details.

=== API Certificates

The master API is secured by certificates that are mounted on the host at
**/etc/origin/**. There are separate directories for master and node certificates. See
link:../../install_config/certificate_customization.html[certificate customization]
for details.

== Registry Service Configuration Settings

The Docker registry service has its own configuration file. This file is where
storage drivers are configured. Storage drivers provide administrators to
connect the registry to object storage.

By default this file is within the registry pod container. See
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[Registry Storage Configuration]
for more details.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be careful when re-deploying the registry. The quickstart method maps the registry
service to host ports. This mapping must be updated when the registry is
re-deployed.

----
$ oc patch service docker-registry -p \
     '{ "spec": { "type": "NodePort", "selector": {"docker-registry": "default"},
        "ports": [ {"nodePort": 5000, "port": 5000, "targetPort": 5000}] }}'

link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html#securing-the-registry[secure the registry]
for TLS.

== Changing the Session Token length

By default the session token used for **docker login** is 24 hours. This value
may be extended in the master configuration file **/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml**.
In this example the session token expiration is extended to 30 days.

====
----
tokenConfig:
  accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 2592000
----

Restart the origin service to update the running configuration.

----
$ sudo docker restart origin
----

== Project and Image Sharing Modes

{product-title} provides multiple project templates to control how projects and
images are displayed by default. In a **shared** environment, authenticated
users may view and pull any image. In an **non-shared** environment, authenticated
users may only view images they are granted access to. This mode is determined by which
project template is enabled in the master configuration file.

These templates are created in the **default** project. The shared project
template is **default/registry-newproject-template-shared**. The non-shared
project template is **default/registry-newproject-template-unshared**.

To change sharing behavior update the configuration file to point to the
appropriate new project template.

. Edit **/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml**
. Change value for **projectRequestTemplate**

====
----
...
projectConfig:
  projectRequestTemplate: "default/registry-newproject-template-unshared"

and disabling self-provisioning.
