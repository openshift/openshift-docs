= Ensuring reliable etcd performance and scalability
:context: etcd-performance

toc::[]

To ensure optimal performance with etcd, it's important to understand the conditions that affect performance, including node scaling, leader election, log replication, tuning, latency, network jitter, peer round trip time, database size, and Kubernetes API transaction rates.
