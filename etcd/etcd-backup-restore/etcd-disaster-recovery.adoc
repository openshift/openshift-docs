= Disaster recovery
:context: etcd-disaster-recovery

toc::[]

The disaster recovery documentation provides information for administrators on how to recover from several disaster situations that might occur with their {product-title} cluster. As an administrator, you might need to follow one or more of the following procedures to return your cluster to a working state.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disaster recovery requires you to have at least one healthy control plane host.

[id="etcd-dr-quorum"]
== Quorum restoration

You can use the `quorum-restore.sh` script to restore etcd quorum on clusters that are offline due to quorum loss. When quorum is lost, the {product-title} API becomes read-only. After quorum is restored, the {product-title} API returns to read/write mode.

[id="etcd-dr-restore"]
== Restoring to a previous cluster state

To restore the cluster to a previous state, you must have previously backed up the `etcd` data by creating a snapshot. You will use this snapshot to restore the cluster state. For more information, see "Backing up etcd data".

If applicable, you might also need to xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates].

[WARNING]
====
Restoring to a previous cluster state is a destructive and destablizing action to take on a running cluster. This procedure should only be used as a last resort.

Before performing a restore, see "About restoring to a previous cluster state" for more information on the impact to the cluster.
