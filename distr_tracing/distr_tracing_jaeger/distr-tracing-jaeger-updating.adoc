[WARNING]
====
Jaeger is deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing 3.0. See the xref:../distr_tracing_rn/distr-tracing-rn-3-0.adoc[release notes] for more information.
====

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) controls the installation, upgrade, and role-based access control (RBAC) of Operators in a cluster. The OLM runs by default in {product-title}.
OLM queries for available Operators as well as upgrades for installed Operators.

During an update, the {DTProductName} Operators upgrade the managed {DTShortName} instances to the version associated with the Operator. Whenever a new version of the {JaegerName} Operator is installed, all the {JaegerShortName} application instances managed by the Operator are upgraded to the Operator's version. For example, after upgrading the Operator from 1.10 installed to 1.11, the Operator scans for running {JaegerShortName} instances and upgrades them to 1.11 as well.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have not already updated your OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator as described in xref:../../logging/cluster-logging-upgrading.adoc#cluster-logging-upgrading_cluster-logging-upgrading[Updating OpenShift Logging], complete that update before updating your {JaegerName} Operator.
