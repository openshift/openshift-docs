[WARNING]
====
Jaeger is deprecated in Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing 3.0. See the xref:../distr_tracing_rn/distr-tracing-rn-3-0.adoc[release notes] for more information.
====

You can install {DTProductName} on {product-title} in either of two ways:

* You can install {DTProductName} as part of {SMProductName}. Distributed tracing is included by default in the Service Mesh installation. To install {DTProductName} as part of a service mesh, follow the xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/preparing-ossm-installation.adoc#preparing-ossm-installation[Red Hat Service Mesh Installation] instructions. You must install {DTProductName} in the same namespace as your service mesh, that is, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` and the {DTProductName} resources must be in the same namespace.

* If you do not want to install a service mesh, you can use the {DTProductName} Operators to install {DTShortName} by itself. To install {DTProductName} without a service mesh, use the following instructions.
