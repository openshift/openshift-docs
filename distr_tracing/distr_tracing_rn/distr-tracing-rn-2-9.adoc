=== Bug fixes

* Before this update, connection was refused due to a missing gRPC port on the `jaeger-query` deployment. This issue resulted in `transport: Error while dialing: dial tcp :16685: connect: connection refused` error message. With this update, the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) is successfully exposed on the Jaeger Query service. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3322[TRACING-3322])

* Before this update, the wrong port was exposed for `jaeger-production-query`, resulting in refused connection. With this update, the issue is fixed by exposing the Jaeger Query gRPC port (16685) on the Jaeger Query deployment. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2968[TRACING-2968])

* Before this update, when deploying {SMProductShortName} on {sno} clusters in disconnected environments, the Jaeger pod frequently went into the `Pending` state. With this update, the issue is fixed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3312[TRACING-3312])

* Before this update, the Jaeger Operator pod restarted with the default memory value due to the `reason: OOMKilled` error message. With this update, this issue is fixed by removing the resource limits. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3173[TRACING-3173])

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[id="new-features-and-enhancements_tempo-release-notes_distributed-tracing-rn-2-9"]
=== New features and enhancements

This release introduces the following enhancements for the {TempoShortName}:

* Support the link:https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/[operator maturity] Level IV, Deep Insights, which enables upgrading, monitoring, and alerting of `TempoStack` instances and the {TempoOperator}.

* Add Ingress and Route configuration for the Gateway.

* Support the `managed` and `unmanaged` states in the `TempoStack` custom resource.

* Expose the following additional ingestion protocols in the Distributor service: Jaeger Thrift binary, Jaeger Thrift compact, Jaeger gRPC, and Zipkin. When the Gateway is enabled, only the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) gRPC is enabled.

* Expose the Jaeger Query gRPC endpoint on the Query Frontend service.

* Support multitenancy without Gateway authentication and authorization.

[id="bug-fixes_tempo-release-notes_distributed-tracing-rn-2-9"]
=== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the {TempoOperator} was not compatible with disconnected environments. With this update, the {TempoOperator} supports disconnected environments. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3145[TRACING-3145])

* Before this update, the {TempoOperator} with TLS failed to start on {product-title}. With this update, the mTLS communication is enabled between Tempo components, the Operand starts successfully, and the Jaeger UI is accessible. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3091[TRACING-3091])

* Before this update, the resource limits from the {TempoOperator} caused error messages such as `reason: OOMKilled`. With this update, the resource limits for the {TempoOperator} are removed to avoid such errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3204[TRACING-3204])

[id="known-issues_tempo-release-notes_distributed-tracing-rn-2-9"]
=== Known issues

* Currently, the custom TLS CA option is not implemented for connecting to object storage. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3462[TRACING-3462])

* Currently, when used with the {TempoOperator}, the Jaeger UI only displays services that have sent traces in the last 15 minutes. For services that did not send traces in the last 15 minutes, traces are still stored but not displayed in the Jaeger UI. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3139[TRACING-3139])

* Currently, the {TempoShortName} fails on the IBM Z (`s390x`) architecture. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3545[TRACING-3545])

* Currently, the Tempo query frontend service must not use internal mTLS when Gateway is not deployed. This issue does not affect the Jaeger Query API. The workaround is to disable mTLS. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3510[TRACING-3510])
+
.Workaround
+
Disable mTLS as follows:
+
. Open the {TempoOperator} ConfigMap for editing by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit configmap tempo-operator-manager-config -n openshift-tempo-operator <1>
----
<1> The project where the {TempoOperator} is installed.

. Disable the mTLS in the operator configuration by updating the YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
data:
  controller_manager_config.yaml: |
    featureGates:
      httpEncryption: false
      grpcEncryption: false
      builtInCertManagement:
        enabled: false
----

. Restart the {TempoOperator} pod by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart deployment.apps/tempo-operator-controller -n openshift-tempo-operator
----


* Missing images for running the {TempoOperator} in restricted environments. The {TempoName} CSV is missing references to the operand images. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-3523[TRACING-3523])
+
.Workaround
+
Add the {TempoOperator} related images in the mirroring tool to mirror the images to the registry:
+
[source,yaml]

* Support the `managed` and `unmanaged` states in the `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resouce.
