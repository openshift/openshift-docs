== New features and enhancements

This release introduces the following new features and enhancements:

* Rebrands Red Hat OpenShift Jaeger as the {DTProductName}.

* Updates {JaegerName} Operator to Jaeger 1.28. Going forward, the {DTProductName} will only support the `stable` Operator channel.
Channels for individual releases are no longer supported.

* Adds support for OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) to the Query service.

* Introduces a new distributed tracing icon that appears in the OpenShift OperatorHub.

* Includes rolling updates to the documentation to support the name change and new features.

== Technology Preview features

* This release adds the {OTELName} as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview], which you install using the {OTELName} Operator. {OTELName} is based on the link:https://opentelemetry.io/[OpenTelemetry] APIs and instrumentation. The {OTELName} includes the OpenTelemetry Operator and Collector. You can use the Collector to receive traces in the OpenTelemetry or Jaeger protocol and send the trace data to the {DTProductName}. Other capabilities of the Collector are not supported at this time. The OpenTelemetry Collector allows developers to instrument their code with vendor agnostic APIs, avoiding vendor lock-in and enabling a growing ecosystem of observability tooling.
