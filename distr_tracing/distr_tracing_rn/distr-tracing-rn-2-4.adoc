== New features and enhancements

This release adds support for auto-provisioning certificates using the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator.

* Self-provisioning by using the {JaegerName} Operator to call the Red Hat Elasticsearch Operator during installation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When upgrading to the {DTProductName} 2.4, the operator recreates the Elasticsearch instance, which might take five to ten minutes. Distributed tracing will be down and unavailable for that period.
