Configuring a cluster to include your own preconfigured virtual private cloud (VPC) allows for the use of any existing network that relies on an existing VPC.

[id="byo-vpc-single-preq"]
== Prerequisites

* You have a configured VPC.
* You have a configured AWS account in your AWS organization. The account should have the following:
.. An IAM user with the name `osdCcsAdmin`
.. The `AdministratorAccess` policy attached to this IAM user

After you have the AWS account ID, you are ready to add a preconfigured VPC.
