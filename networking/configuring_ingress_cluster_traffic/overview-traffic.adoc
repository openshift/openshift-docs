{product-title} provides the following methods for communicating from
outside the cluster with services running in the cluster.

The methods are recommended, in order or preference:

* If you have HTTP/HTTPS, use an Ingress Controller.
* If you have a TLS-encrypted protocol other than HTTPS. For example, for TLS
with the SNI header, use an Ingress Controller.
* Otherwise, use a Load Balancer, an External IP, or a `NodePort`.
