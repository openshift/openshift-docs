The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides a Kubernetes API for performing state-driven network configuration across the {product-title} cluster's nodes with NMState. The Kubernetes NMState Operator provides users with functionality to configure various network interface types, DNS, and routing on cluster nodes. Additionally, the daemons on the cluster nodes periodically report on the state of each node's network interfaces to the API server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red Hat supports the Kubernetes NMState Operator in production environments on bare-metal, IBM Power, IBM Z, and LinuxONE installations only. For other platforms, the Kubernetes NMState Operator is a Technology Preview. See the following Technology Preview statement for support limitations when using Kubernetes NMState on platforms other than bare metal, IBM Power, IBM Z, and LinuxONE.
