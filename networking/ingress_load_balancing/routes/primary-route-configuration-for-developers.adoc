= Basic route configuration for Developers

toc::[]

Developers can create and configure a route to work with the `IngressController`. Routes can be basic or secure, with a wide variety of options to suit every environment.

//Ingress Traffic Overview

If you use unencrypted HTTP, you need to use a basic route option. There are five options you can implement with basic routes: 

[[basic-route-types-table]]
[options="header"]

//Sharding - note we will need a whole assembly just on sharding
Sharding is the most advanced basic route. You only need to set up sharding if you will be running hundreds or thousands of applications on your cluster.
