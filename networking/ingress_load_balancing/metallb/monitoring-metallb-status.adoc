As an {product-title} system administrator, you can gain insights into the operational status of your MetalLB deployments by examining the status of its custom resources (CRs). These status fields provide information about IP address allocations, BGP peer announcements, and session states, which are important for effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

For more information about how to install the MetalLB Operator, see xref:../../../networking/networking_operators/metallb-operator/about-metallb.adoc#about-metallb[About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator].
