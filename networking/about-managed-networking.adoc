{openshift-networking} is an ecosystem of features, plugins, and advanced networking capabilities that enhance Kubernetes networking with advanced networking-related features that your cluster needs to manage network traffic for one or multiple hybrid clusters. This ecosystem of networking capabilities integrates ingress, egress, load balancing, high-performance throughput, security, and inter- and intra-cluster traffic management. The {openshift-networking} ecosystem also provides role-based observability tooling to reduce its natural complexities.

The following are some of the most commonly used {openshift-networking} features available on your cluster:

* Cluster Network Operator for network plugin management
+
* Primary cluster network provided by either of the following Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins:
+
** xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin], which is the default CNI plugin.
** {OCP-short} SDN network plugin, which was deprecated in {OCP-short} 4.16 and removed in {OCP-short} 4.17.
