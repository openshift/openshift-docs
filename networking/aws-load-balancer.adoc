The AWS Load Balancer Operator (ALBO) is a Red-Hat managed Operator that users can optionally install on SRE-managed {product-title} clusters. The ALBO manages the life cycle of AWS-managed AWS Load Balancer Controller (ALBC) that provisions Amazon Elastic Load Balancing v2 services for applications running in {product-title} clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* ALBO supports Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in either single-AZ or multi-AZ cluster configurations.
* Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are supported in multi-AZ {product-title} cluster configurations only.
* Since AWS Load Balancer Controller does not support creating ALBs associated with both Availability Zones and Local Zones, ROSA clusters can have ALBs associated exclusively with either Local Zones or Availability Zones but not together.
