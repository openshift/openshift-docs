= Configuring a cluster-wide proxy during installation
:context: cluster-wide-proxy-configuration

toc::[]

You can configure a cluster-wide proxy during cluster installation or after the cluster has been installed.

//OSDOCS-2830 Customer Responsibilities
If you use a cluster-wide proxy, you are responsible for the following:

* Maintaining the availability of the proxy to the cluster.
* Understanding that if the proxy becomes unavailable, then it may impact the health and supportability of the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Cluster-wide proxy is a functionally-complete feature and suitable for production workloads. There are additional considerations that need to be added to documentation, and until then, this feature is considered a Technology Preview.

//OSDOCS-3290 Transparent Proxy Update
[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of a proxy server to perform TLS re-encryption is currently not supported if the server is acting as a transparent forward proxy where it is not configured on-cluster via the `--http-proxy` or `--https-proxy` arguments.

A transparent forward proxy intercepts the cluster’s traffic, but it is not actually configured on the cluster itself.

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
[NOTE]
====
You should not attempt to change the proxy or additional trust bundle configuration on the cluster itself. These changes should always be done via the `rosa` command-line tools. Any changes that are made directly to the cluster will be reverted automatically.

=== Responsibilites for additional trust bundles

If you supplied an additional trust bundle file, you are responsible for the following:

* Ensuring that the contents of the additional trust bundle are valid,
* Ensuring that the certificates, including intermediary certificates, contained in the additional trust bundle have not expired, and
* Tracking the expiry and performing any necessary renewals for certificates contained in the additional trust bundle, and subsequently updating the cluster’s configuration with the updated additional trust bundle.
