= Configuring a cluster-wide proxy
:context: configuring-a-cluster-wide-proxy

toc::[]

If you are using an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can configure a cluster-wide proxy during
ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
a {product-title} (ROSA)
endif::openshift-rosa[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
an {product-title}
endif::openshift-dedicated[]
cluster installation or after the cluster is installed. When you enable a proxy, the core cluster components are denied direct access to the internet, but the proxy does not affect user workloads.

[NOTE]
====
Only cluster system egress traffic is proxied, including calls to the cloud provider API.
====

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
You can enable a proxy only for {product-title} clusters that use the Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) model.
endif::openshift-dedicated[]

If you use a cluster-wide proxy, you are responsible for maintaining the availability of the proxy to the cluster. If the proxy becomes unavailable, then it might impact the health and supportability of the cluster.

== Configuring a proxy during installation

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
You can configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy when you install an {product-title} with Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS) cluster into an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). You can configure the proxy during installation by using {cluster-manager-first}.

== Removing a cluster-wide proxy

You can remove your cluster-wide proxy by using the ROSA CLI. After removing the cluster, you should also remove any trust bundles that are added to the cluster.
