The automatic upgrade procedure does not work as expected from {product-title} 4.10 and earlier. A summary of the upgrade procedure is as follows:

. Delete the previously installed Operator version for example 4.10. Ensure that the namespace and the `metallb` custom resource are not removed.

. Install the 4.11 version of the Operator using the CLI. Install the 4.11 version of the Operator in the same namespace that the previously installed Operator version was installed to.

[NOTE]
====
This procedure does not apply to automatic z-stream updates of the MetalLB Operator, which follow the standard straightforward method.
