toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can add the MetalLB Operator to your cluster so that when a service of type `LoadBalancer` is added to the cluster, MetalLB can add a fault-tolerant external IP address for the service.
The external IP address is added to the host network for your cluster.

== Limitations and restrictions

// With fair confidence, this topic is temporary for 4.9.
[id="support-layer2-only_{context}"]
=== Support for layer 2 only

When you install and configure MetalLB on {product-title} 4.9 with the MetalLB Operator, support is restricted to layer 2 mode only.
In comparison, the open source MetalLB project offers load balancing for layer 2 mode and a mode for layer 3 that uses border gateway protocol (BGP).

// Ditto. This limitation should be lifted in 4.10.
[id="support-single-stack_{context}"]
=== Support for single stack networking

Although you can specify IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses in the same address pool, MetalLB only assigns one IP address for the load balancer.

When MetalLB is deployed on a cluster that is configured for dual-stack networking, MetalLB assigns one IPv4 or IPv6 address for the load balancer, depending on the IP address family of the cluster IP for the service.
For example, if the cluster IP of the service is IPv4, then MetalLB assigns an IPv4 address for the load balancer.
MetalLB does not assign an IPv4 and an IPv6 address simultaneously.

IPv6 is only supported for clusters that use the OVN-Kubernetes network provider.

// Incompat with IP failover
[id="incompatibility-with-ip-failover_{context}"]
=== Incompatibility with IP failover

MetalLB is incompatible with the IP failover feature. Before you install the MetalLB Operator, remove IP failover.
