toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can add the MetalLB Operator to your cluster so that when a service of type `LoadBalancer` is added to the cluster, MetalLB can add an external IP address for the service.
The external IP address is added to the host network for your cluster.

You can configure MetalLB so that the IP address is advertised with layer 2 protocols.
With layer 2, MetalLB provides a fault-tolerant external IP address.

You can configure MetalLB so that the IP address is advertised with the BGP protocol.
With BGP, MetalLB provides fault-tolerance for the external IP address and load balancing.

MetalLB supports providing layer 2 for some IP addresses and BGP for other IP addresses.

[id="incompatibility-with-ip-failover_{context}"]
=== Incompatibility with IP failover

MetalLB is incompatible with the IP failover feature. Before you install the MetalLB Operator, remove IP failover.
