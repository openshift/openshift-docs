toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can add the MetallB Operator so that the Operator can manage the lifecycle for an instance of MetalLB on your cluster.

The installation procedures use the `metallb-system` namespace.
You can install the Operator and configure custom resources in a different namespace.
The Operator starts MetalLB in the same namespace that the Operator is installed in.

MetalLB and IP failover are incompatible. If you configured IP failover for your cluster, perform the steps to xref:../../networking/configuring-ipfailover.adoc#nw-ipfailover-remove_configuring-ipfailover[remove IP failover] before you install the Operator.
