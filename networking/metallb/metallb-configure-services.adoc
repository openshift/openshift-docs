As a cluster administrator, when you add a service of type `LoadBalancer`, you can control how MetalLB assigns an IP address.

// Request a specific IP address
[id="request-specific-ip-address_{context}"]
== Request a specific IP address

Like some other load-balancer implementations, MetalLB accepts the `spec.loadBalancerIP` field in the service specification.

If the requested IP address is within a range from any address pool, MetalLB assigns the requested IP address.
If the requested IP address is not within any range, MetalLB reports a warning.

.Example service YAML for a specific IP address
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <service_name>
  annotations:
    metallb.universe.tf/address-pool: <address_pool_name>
spec:
  selector:
    <label_key>: <label_value>
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: <ip_address>
----

If MetalLB cannot assign the requested IP address, the `EXTERNAL-IP` for the service reports `<pending>` and running `oc describe service <service_name>` includes an event like the following example.

[id="request-ip-address-from-pool_{context}"]
== Request an IP address from a specific pool

To assign an IP address from a specific range, but you are not concerned with the specific IP address, then you can use the `metallb.universe.tf/address-pool` annotation to request an IP address from the specified address pool.

  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      protocol: TCP
  type: LoadBalancer
----

If the address pool that you specify for `<address_pool_name>` does not exist, MetalLB attempts to assign an IP address from any pool that permits automatic assignment.

[id="accept-any-ip-address_{context}"]
== Accept any IP address

By default, address pools are configured to permit automatic assignment.
MetalLB assigns an IP address from these address pools.

To accept any IP address from any pool that is configured for automatic assignment, no special annotation or configuration is required.

----

[id="share-specific-ip-address_{context}"]
== Share a specific IP address

By default, services do not share IP addresses.
However, if you need to colocate services on a single IP address, you can enable selective IP sharing by adding the `metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip` annotation to the services.

----
<1> Specify the same value for the `metallb.universe.tf/allow-shared-ip` annotation. This value is referred to as the _sharing key_.
<2> Specify different port numbers for the services.
<3> Specify identical pod selectors if you must specify `externalTrafficPolicy: local` so the services send traffic to the same set of pods. If you use the `cluster` external traffic policy, then the pod selectors do not need to be identical.
<4> Optional: If you specify the three preceding items, MetalLB might colocate the services on the same IP address. To ensure that services share an IP address, specify the IP address to share.

By default, Kubernetes does not allow multiprotocol load balancer services.
This limitation would normally make it impossible to run a service like DNS that needs to listen on both TCP and UDP.
To work around this limitation of Kubernetes with MetalLB, create two services:

* For one service, specify TCP and for the second service, specify UDP.

* In both services, specify the same pod selector.

* Specify the same sharing key and `spec.loadBalancerIP` value to colocate the TCP and UDP services on the same IP address.
