{product-title} uses a software-defined networking (SDN) approach to provide a
unified cluster network that enables communication between Pods across the
{product-title} cluster. This Pod network is established and maintained by the
OpenShift SDN, which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS).

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
OpenShift SDN provides three SDN modes for configuring the Pod network:

// TODO - this link fails ccutil build
* The _network policy_ mode allows project administrators to configure their own
isolation policies using xref:../../networking/configuring-networkpolicy.adoc#configuring-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy objects].
NetworkPolicy is the default mode in {product-title} {product-version}.

* The _multitenant_ mode provides project-level isolation for Pods and Services.
Pods from different projects cannot send packets to or receive packets from Pods
and Services of a different project. You can disable isolation for a project,
allowing it to send network traffic to all Pods and Services in the entire
cluster and receive network traffic from those Pods and Services.

* The _subnet_ mode provides a flat Pod network where every Pod can
communicate with every other Pod and Service. The network policy mode provides
the same functionality as the subnet mode.

{product-title} SDN supports only the _network policy_ mode, which allows project
administrators to configure their own isolation policies by using
xref:../../networking/configuring-networkpolicy.adoc#configuring-networkpolicy[NetworkPolicy objects].
