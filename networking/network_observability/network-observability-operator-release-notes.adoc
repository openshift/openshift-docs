=== Preparing for the next update 

The subscription of an installed Operator specifies an update channel that tracks and receives updates for the Operator. Until the 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator, the only channel available was `v1.0.x`. The 1.2 release of the Network Observability Operator introduces the `stable` update channel for tracking and receiving updates. You must switch your channel from `v1.0.x` to `stable` to receive future Operator updates. The `v1.0.x` channel is deprecated and planned for removal in a following release.

=== Bug fix

* Previously, unless the Loki `authToken` configuration was set to `FORWARD` mode, authentication was no longer enforced, allowing any user who could connect to the {product-title} console in an {product-title} cluster to retrieve flows without authentication.
Now, regardless of the Loki `authToken` mode, only cluster administrators can retrieve flows. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2169468[*BZ#2169468*])
