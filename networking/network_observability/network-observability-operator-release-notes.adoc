=== Bug fix

* Previously, when the Loki `authToken` configuration was set to `HOST` mode, user authentication was not enforced. This allowed anyone who could connect to the {product-title} console in an {product-title} cluster to retrieve flows. User authentication was only enforced if the `authToken` configuration was set to `FORWARD`. Now, if Loki `authToken` mode is set to `FORWARD` or `HOST`, only cluster administrators can retrieve flows. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2169468[*BZ#2169468*])
