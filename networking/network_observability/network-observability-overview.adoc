Red Hat offers cluster administrators the Network Observability Operator to observe the network traffic for {product-title} clusters. The Network Observability uses the eBPF technology to create network flows. The network flows are then enriched with {product-title} information and stored in Loki. You can view and analyze the stored netflow information in the {product-title} console for further insight and troubleshooting.

[id="dependency-network-observability"]
== Dependency of Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator requires the following Operators:

* Loki: You must install Loki. Loki is the backend that is used to store all collected flows. It is recommended to install Loki by installing the Red Hat Loki Operator for the installation of Network Observability Operator.

[id="optional-dependency-network-observability"]
== Optional dependencies of the Network Observability Operator

* Grafana: You can install Grafana for using custom dashboards and querying capabilities, by using the Grafana Operator. Red Hat does not support Grafana Operator.
* Kafka: It provides scalability, resiliency and high availability in the {product-title} cluster. It is recommended to install Kafka using the AMQ Streams operator for large scale deployments.

== Network Observability Operator

The Network Observability Operator deploys a monitoring pipeline to collect and enrich the network flows. The Operator provides dashboards, metrics, and keeps flows accessible in the Grafana Loki log store. The eBPF agent, which is deployed as a `daemonset` object, creates the network flows. The network flows are then collected and enriched with the Kubernetes metadata, before storing in Loki.

When the Network Observability Operator is installed, the Flow Collector resource is created. The Flow Collector pilots and configures network flow collection.  When a flow collector is deployed, new dashboards are available in the {product-title} console.

[id="no-console-integration"]
== {product-title} console integration

{product-title} console integration offers overview, topology view and traffic flow tables.

[id="network-observability-dashboards"]
=== Network Observability metrics

By using Network Observability metrics, you can refine the stats by using the filters and display options. The {product-title} console offers the *Overview* tab which displays the overall aggregated metrics of the network traffic flow on the cluster. You can access the information for node, namespace, owner, pod, and service.

[id="network-observability-topology-views"]
=== Network Observability topology views

The {product-title} console offers the *Topology* tab which displays a graphical representation of the network flows and the amount of traffic. The topology view represents traffic between the {product-title} components as a network graph. You can refine the graph by using the filters and display options. You can access the information for node, namespace, owner, pod, and service.

[id="traffic-flow-tables"]
=== Traffic flow tables

The traffic flow table view provides a view for raw flows, non aggregated filtering options, and configurable columns. The {product-title} console offers the *Traffic flows* tab which displays the data of the network flows and the amount of traffic.
