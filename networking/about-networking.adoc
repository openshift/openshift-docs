{openshift-networking} is an ecosystem of features, plugins and advanced networking capabilities that extend Kubernetes networking with the advanced networking-related features that your cluster needs to manage its network traffic for one or multiple hybrid clusters. This ecosystem of networking capabilities integrates ingress, egress, load balancing, high-performance throughput, security, inter- and intra-cluster traffic management and provides role-based observability tooling to reduce its natural complexities.

The following list highlights some of the most commonly used {openshift-networking} features available on your cluster:

- Primary cluster network provided by either of the following Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins:
  * xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin], the default plugin
  * xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/about-openshift-sdn.adoc#about-openshift-sdn[OpenShift SDN network plugin]
- Certified 3rd-party alternative primary network plugins
- Cluster Network Operator for network plugin management
- Ingress Operator for TLS encrypted web traffic
- DNS Operator for name assignment
- MetalLB Operator for traffic load balancing on bare metal clusters
- IP failover support for high-availability
- Additional hardware network support through multiple CNI plugins, including for macvlan, ipvlan, and SR-IOV hardware networks
- IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack addressing
- Hybrid Linux-Windows host clusters for Windows-based workloads
- {SMProductName} for discovery, load balancing, service-to-service authentication, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring of services
- {sno-caps}
- Network Observability Operator for network debugging and insights
