With IPsec enabled, you can encrypt both internal pod-to-pod cluster traffic between nodes and external traffic between pods and IPsec endpoints external to your cluster. All pod-to-pod network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec _Transport mode_.

IPsec is disabled by default. It can be enabled either during or after installing the cluster. For information about cluster installation, see xref:../../installing/index.adoc#ocp-installation-overview[{product-title} installation overview]. If you need to enable IPsec after cluster installation, you must first resize your cluster MTU to account for the overhead of the IPsec ESP IP header.

[NOTE]
====
IPsec on IBM Cloud VPC supports only NAT-T. Using ESP is not supported.
====

Use the procedures in the following documentation to:

* Enable and disable IPSec after cluster installation
* Configure support for external IPsec endpoints outside the cluster
* Verify that IPsec encrypts traffic between pods on different nodes

[id="{context}-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You have decreased the size of the cluster MTU by `46` bytes to allow for the additional overhead of the IPsec ESP header. For more information on resizing the MTU that your cluster uses, see xref:../../networking/changing-cluster-network-mtu.adoc#changing-cluster-network-mtu[Changing the MTU for the cluster network].

[id="{context}-external-traffic-ipsec"]
== IPsec encryption for external traffic

{product-title} supports IPsec encryption for traffic to external hosts.

You must supply a custom IPsec configuration, which includes the IPsec configuration file itself and TLS certificates.

Ensure that the following prohibitions are observed:

* The custom IPsec configuration must not include any connection specifications that might interfere with the cluster's pod-to-pod IPsec configuration.
* Certificate common names (CN) in the provided certificate bundle must not begin with the `ovs_` prefix, because this naming can collide with pod-to-pod IPsec CN names in the Network Security Services (NSS) database of each node.
