toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can convert your IPv4 single-stack cluster to a dual-network cluster network that supports IPv4 and IPv6 address families.
After converting to dual-stack, all newly created pods are dual-stack enabled.

[NOTE]
====
A dual-stack network is supported on clusters provisioned on bare metal, IBM Power infrastructure, and single node OpenShift clusters.
