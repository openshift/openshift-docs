toc::[]

As a cluster administrator you can configure the `gatewayConfig` object to manage how external traffic leaves the cluster. You do so by setting the `routingViaHost` spec to `true` for local mode or `false` for shared mode.

In local gateway mode, traffic is routed through the host and is consequently applied to the routing table of the host. In shared gateway mode, traffic is not routed through the host. Instead, traffic the Open vSwitch (OVS) outputs traffic directly to the node IP interface.
