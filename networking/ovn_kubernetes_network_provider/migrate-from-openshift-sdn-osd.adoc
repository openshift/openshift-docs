As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can initiate the migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin and verify the migration status using the OCM CLI.

Some considerations before starting migration initiation are:

* The cluster version must be 4.16.24 and above.
* The migration process cannot be interrupted.
* Migrating back to the SDN network plugin is not possible.
* Cluster nodes will be rebooted during migration.
* There will be no impact to workloads that are resilient to node disruptions.
* Migration time can vary between several minutes and hours, depending on the cluster size and workload configurations.
