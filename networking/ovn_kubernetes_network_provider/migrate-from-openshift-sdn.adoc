toc::[]

As a {rosa-classic-first} cluster administrator, you can initiate the migration from the OpenShift SDN network plugin to the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin and verify the migration status using the ROSA CLI.

Some considerations before starting migration initiation are:

* The cluster version must be 4.16.24 and above.

* The migration process cannot be interrupted.

* Migrating back to the SDN network plugin is not possible.

* Cluster nodes will be rebooted during migration.

* There will be no impact to workloads that are resilient to node disruptions.

* Migration time can vary between several minutes and hours, depending on the cluster size and workload configurations.
