toc::[]

Production environments can deny direct access to the internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure {product-title} to use a proxy by xref:../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[modifying the Proxy object for existing clusters] or by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file for new clusters.

== Prerequisites

* Review the xref:../installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.adoc#configuring-firewall[sites that your cluster requires access to] and determine whether any of them must bypass the proxy. By default, all cluster system egress traffic is proxied, including calls to the cloud provider API for the cloud that hosts your cluster. System-wide proxy affects system components only, not user workloads. Add sites to the Proxy object's `spec.noProxy` field to bypass the proxy if necessary.

[NOTE]
====
The Proxy object `status.noProxy` field is populated with the values of the `networking.machineNetwork[].cidr`, `networking.clusterNetwork[].cidr`, and `networking.serviceNetwork[]` fields from your installation configuration.

For installations on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and {rh-openstack-first}, the `Proxy` object `status.noProxy` field is also populated with the instance metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`).
