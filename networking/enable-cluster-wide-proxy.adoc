Production environments can deny direct access to the Internet and instead have an HTTP or HTTPS proxy available. You can configure {product-title} to use a proxy by xref:../networking/enable-cluster-wide-proxy.adoc#nw-proxy-configure-object_config-cluster-wide-proxy[modifying the Proxy object for existing clusters] or by configuring the proxy settings in the `install-config.yaml` file for new clusters.

IMPORTANT: The cluster-wide proxy is only supported if you used a user-provisioned infrastructure installation for a supported provider.
