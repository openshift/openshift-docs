You can use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network devices with additional networks on your {product-title} cluster for high performance applications.

== About SR-IOV hardware on {product-title}

{product-title} includes the capability to use SR-IOV hardware on your nodes.
You can attach SR-IOV virtual function (VF) interfaces to Pods on nodes with
SR-IOV hardware.

You can use the {product-title} console to install SR-IOV by deploying the
SR-IOV Network Operator. The SR-IOV Network Operator creates and manages the
components of the SR-IOV stack. The Operator provisions the following
components:

* Provision the SR-IOV network operator deployment on master nodes.
* Provision the SR-IOV network config daemon on worker nodes.
* Provision the Operator webhook on master nodes.
* Provision the Network resources injector on master nodes.
* Provision the SR-IOV network device plug-in on worker nodes.
* Provision the SR-IOV CNI plug-in executable on worker nodes.

Here's the function of each above mentioned SR-IOV components.

* The SR-IOV Operator is a Kubernetes Deployment that manages all SR-IOV
components in a cluster. It watches creation, update and deletion of Operator
Custom Resources and takes corresponding actions such as generating
NetworkAttachmentDefinition Custom Resources for SR-IOV CNI, creating and
updating configuration of SR-IOV network device plug-in, creating node
specific SriovNetworkNodeState Custom Resources and updating Spec.Interfaces
field in each SriovNetworkNodeState Custom Resource, etc.

* The SR-IOV network config daemon is a Kubernetes DaemonSet deployed on
worker nodes when SR-IOV Operator is launched. It is responsible for
discovering and initializing SR-IOV network devices in cluster.

* The Operator webhook is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller Webhook
that validates correctness of Operator Custom Resource and sets default values
for fields in Operator Custom Resource that are not configured by user.

* The Network resources injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller
Webhook that provides functionality for patching Kubernetes Pod specifications
with requests and limits for custom network resources such as SR-IOV VFs.

* The SR-IOV network device plug-in is a Kubernetes device plug-in for
discovering, advertising, and allocating SR-IOV network virtual function (VF)
resources. Device plug-ins are used in Kubernetes to enable the use of limited
resources, typically in physical devices. Device plug-ins give the Kubernetes
scheduler awareness of resource availability, so the scheduler can schedule
Pods on nodes with sufficient resources.

* The SR-IOV CNI plug-in plumbs VF interfaces allocated from the SR-IOV device
plug-in directly into a Pod.

[NOTE]
====
The Network resources injector and Operator webhook are enabled by default and
can be disabled by editting default SriovOperatorConfig CR.
