toc::[]

The Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) specification is a standard for a type of PCI device assignment that can share a single device with multiple pods.

SR-IOV enables you to segment a compliant network device, recognized on the host node as a physical function (PF), into multiple virtual functions (VFs).
The VF is used like any other network device.
The SR-IOV device driver for the device determines how the VF is exposed in the container:

* `netdevice` driver: A regular kernel network device in the `netns` of the container
* `vfio-pci` driver: A character device mounted in the container

You can use SR-IOV network devices with additional networks on your {product-title} cluster for application that require high bandwidth or low latency.

== Components that manage SR-IOV network devices

The SR-IOV Network Operator creates and manages the components of the SR-IOV stack.
It performs the following functions:

- Orchestrates discovery and management of SR-IOV network devices
- Generates NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources for the SR-IOV Container Network Interface (CNI)
- Creates and updates the configuration of the SR-IOV network device plug-in
- Creates node specific SriovNetworkNodeState custom resources
- Updates the `spec.interfaces` field in each SriovNetworkNodeState custom resource

The Operator provisions the following components:

SR-IOV network configuration daemon::
A DaemonSet that is deployed on worker nodes when the SR-IOV Operator starts. The daemon is responsible for discovering and initializing SR-IOV network devices in the cluster.

SR-IOV Operator webhook::
A dynamic admission controller webhook that validates the Operator custom resource and sets appropriate default values for unset fields.

SR-IOV Network resources injector::
A dynamic admission controller webhook that provides functionality for patching Kubernetes Pod specifications with requests and limits for custom network resources such as SR-IOV VFs.

SR-IOV network device plug-in::
A device plug-in that discovers, advertises, and allocates SR-IOV network virtual function (VF) resources. Device plug-ins are used in Kubernetes to enable the use of limited resources, typically in physical devices. Device plug-ins give the Kubernetes scheduler awareness of resource availability, so that the scheduler can schedule Pods on nodes with sufficient resources.

SR-IOV CNI plug-in::
A CNI plug-in that attaches VF interfaces allocated from the SR-IOV device plug-in directly into a Pod.

SR-IOV InfiniBand CNI plug-in::
A CNI plug-in that attaches InfiniBand (IB) VF interfaces allocated from the SR-IOV device plug-in directly into a Pod.

[NOTE]
====
The SR-IOV Network resources injector and SR-IOV Network Operator webhook are enabled by default and can be disabled by editing the `default` SriovOperatorConfig CR.
