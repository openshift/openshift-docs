You can use Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) network devices with additional networks on your {product-title} cluster for high performance applications.

== Guidelines for using SR-IOV network devices

{product-title} allows you to use SR-IOV hardware on your nodes.

You can attach SR-IOV virtual function (VF) interfaces to Pods on nodes with
SR-IOV hardware.

You can use the {product-title} console to install SR-IOV by deploying the
SR-IOV Network Operator. The SR-IOV Network Operator creates and manages the
components of the SR-IOV stack. The Operator provisions the following
components:

* The SR-IOV Network Operator is a Kubernetes deployment that manages all SR-IOV components in a cluster. It watches the creation, update, and deletion of Operator custom resources and takes corresponding actions such as generating NetworkAttachmentDefinition custom resources for SR-IOV CNI, creating and updating configuration of SR-IOV network device plug-in, creating node specific SriovNetworkNodeState custom resources and updating Spec.Interfaces field in each SriovNetworkNodeState custom resource. 

* The SR-IOV network config daemon is a Kubernetes DaemonSet deployed on worker nodes when SR-IOV Operator is launched. It is responsible for discovering and initializing SR-IOV network devices in cluster.

* The Operator webhook is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller Webhook that validates correctness of Operator custom resource and sets default values for fields in Operator custom resource that are not configured by user.

* The Network resources injector is a Kubernetes Dynamic Admission Controller Webhook that provides functionality for patching Kubernetes Pod specifications with requests and limits for custom network resources such as SR-IOV VFs.

* The SR-IOV network device plug-in is a Kubernetes device plug-in for discovering, advertising, and allocating SR-IOV network virtual function (VF) resources. Device plug-ins are used in Kubernetes to enable the use of limited resources, typically in physical devices. Device plug-ins give the Kubernetes scheduler awareness of resource availability, so the scheduler can schedule Pods on nodes with sufficient resources.

* The SR-IOV CNI plug-in plumbs VF interfaces allocated from the SR-IOV device plug-in directly into a Pod.

[NOTE]
====
The Network resources injector and Operator webhook are enabled by default and
can be disabled by editing default SriovOperatorConfig CR.
