== About Redfish hardware events

{product-title} enables your monitoring services to consume cloud-native events from Redfish hardware event-capable equipment. The events are published on a node and transmitted on an advanced message queue to your subscribing applications.

[NOTE]
====
Redfish hardware events work with Redfish-capable devices on a single-node cluster provisioned only on bare-metal infrastructure.
====

The hardware-related events published through Redfish to monitoring applications may include temperature, infrastructure such as servers, routers, fans. Application developers can use APIs to get updates on things that have or could go wrong.

A typical use case is the monitoring of hardware faults in Edge devices such as distributed units (DUs) and  virtual distributed units (vDUs) and other forms of Advance Communication Devices.
Redfish hardware events provide the basis for a standard network monitoring services that is cloud friendly and secure.

You can use the {product-title} console to install Redfish hardware events by deploying the Operator Hub. The Operator Hub creates and manages the <service_name> services and provides the following features:

* Discovery of the Redfish hardware events compatible devices in the cluster.

* Management of the configuration of <service_name> services.

* Notification of Redfish hardware events that negatively affect the performance and reliability of your applications using the Operator `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar.
