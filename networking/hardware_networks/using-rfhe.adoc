== About Redfish hardware events

{product-title} allows you use Redfish hardware events on a node. You can configure <service_name> services on nodes that have Redfish hardware event-capable hardware.

[NOTE]
====
Redfish hardware events work with Redfish-capable devices on a single-node cluster provisioned only on bare-metal infrastructure.

About exposing hardware-related events through Redfish
temperature, other h/w/ issues - calling an API and getting updates on things that have or could go wrong.
Hardware faults in Edge devices like distributed units (DUs).
cloud friendly and secure
about remote management of servers (limitations with vendors with their own interpretations of Redfish)

You can use the {product-title} console to install Redfish hardware events by deploying the Operator Hub. The Operator Hub creates and manages the <service_name> services and provides the following features:

* Discovery of the Redfish hardware events compatible devices in the cluster.

* Management of the configuration of <service_name> services.

* Notification of Redfish hardware events that negatively affect the performance and reliability of your applications using the Operator `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar.
