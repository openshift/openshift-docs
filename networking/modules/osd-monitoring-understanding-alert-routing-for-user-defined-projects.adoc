= Understanding alert routing for user-defined projects

[role="_abstract"]
As a cluster administrator, you can enable alert routing for user-defined projects. 
With this feature, you can allow users with the **alert-routing-edit** role to configure alert notification routing and receivers for user-defined projects.
These notifications are routed by an Alertmanager instance dedicated to user-defined monitoring.

Users can then create and configure user-defined alert routing by creating or editing the `AlertmanagerConfig` objects for their user-defined projects without the help of an administrator.

After a user has defined alert routing for a user-defined project, user-defined alert notifications are routed to the `alertmanager-user-workload` pods in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
The following are limitations of alert routing for user-defined projects:

* For user-defined alerting rules, user-defined routing is scoped to the namespace in which the resource is defined.
For example, a routing configuration in namespace `ns1` only applies to `PrometheusRules` resources in the same namespace.

* When a namespace is excluded from user-defined monitoring, `AlertmanagerConfig` resources in the namespace cease to be part of the Alertmanager configuration.
