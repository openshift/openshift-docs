= Creating a new tailored profile

You can write a tailored profile from scratch using the `TailoredProfile` object. Set an appropriate `title` and `description` and leave the `extends` field empty. Indicate to the Compliance Operator what type of scan will this custom profile generate:

* Node scan: Scans the Operating System.
* Platform scan: Scans the OpenShift configuration.

.Procedure

Set the following annotation on the `TailoredProfile` object:
+
.Example `new-profile.yaml`
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: compliance.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: TailoredProfile
metadata:
  name: new-profile
  annotations:
    compliance.openshift.io/product-type: Node <1>
spec:
  extends:
  description: My custom profile <2>
  title: Custom profile <3>
----
<1> Set `Node` or `Platform` accordingly.
<2> Use the `description` field to describe the function of the new `TailoredProfile` object.
<3> Give your `TailoredProfile` object a title with the `title` field.
+
[NOTE]
====
Adding the `-node` suffix to the `name` field of the `TailoredProfile` object is similar to adding the `Node` product type annotation and generates an Operating System scan.
