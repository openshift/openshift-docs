= Configuring the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry

You can configure the hub cluster to use a disconnected mirror registry for a disconnected environment.

.Prerequisites

* You have a disconnected hub cluster installation with {rh-rhacm-first} {rh-rhacm-version} installed.

* You have hosted the `rootfs` and `iso` images on an HTTP server.

[WARNING]
====
If you enable TLS for the HTTP server, you must confirm the root certificate is signed by an authority trusted by the client and verify the trusted certificate chain between your {product-title} hub and managed clusters and the HTTP server. Using a server configured with an untrusted certificate prevents the images from being downloaded to the image creation service. Using untrusted HTTPS servers is not supported.
====

.Procedure

. Create a `ConfigMap` containing the mirror registry config:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: assisted-installer-mirror-config
  namespace: assisted-installer
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: <certificate> <1>
  registries.conf: |  <2>
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]

    [[registry]]
      location = <mirror_registry_url>  <3>
      insecure = false
      mirror-by-digest-only = true
----
<1> The mirror registryâ€™s certificate used when creating the mirror registry.
<2> The configuration for the mirror registry.
<3> The URL of the mirror registry.
+
This updates `mirrorRegistryRef` in the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource, as shown below:
+
.Example output
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
  namespace: assisted-installer
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    volumeName: <db_pv_name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <db_storage_size>
  filesystemStorage:
    volumeName: <fs_pv_name>
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: <fs_storage_size>
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: 'assisted-installer-mirror-config'
  osImages:
    - openshiftVersion: <ocp_version>
      rootfs: <rootfs_url> <1>
      url: <iso_url> <1>
----
<1> Must match the URLs of the HTTPD server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A valid NTP server is required during cluster installation. Ensure that a suitable NTP server is available and can be reached from the installed clusters through the disconnected network.
