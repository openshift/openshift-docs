= {product-title} infrastructure components

The following infrastructure workloads do not incur {product-title} worker subscriptions:

* Kubernetes and {product-title} control plane services that run on masters
* The default router
* The integrated container image registry
* The HAProxy-based Ingress Controller
* The cluster metrics collection, or monitoring service, including components for monitoring user-defined projects
* Cluster aggregated logging
* Service brokers
* Red Hat Quay
* {rh-storage-first}
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Manager
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes
* Red Hat OpenShift GitOps
* Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines

// Updated the list to match the list under "Red Hat OpenShift control plane and infrastructure nodes" in https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/openshift-subscription-sizing-guide

Any node that runs any other container, pod, or component is a worker node that your subscription must cover.
