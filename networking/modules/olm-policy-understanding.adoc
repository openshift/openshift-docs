= Understanding Operator installation policy

Operators can require wide privileges to run, and the required privileges can change between versions. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) runs with `cluster-admin` privileges. By default, Operator authors can specify any set of permissions in the cluster service version (CSV), and OLM consequently grants it to the Operator.

To ensure that an Operator cannot achieve cluster-scoped privileges and that users cannot escalate privileges using OLM, Cluster administrators can manually audit Operators before they are added to the cluster. Cluster administrators are also provided tools for determining and constraining which actions are allowed during an Operator installation or upgrade using service accounts.

Cluster administrators can associate an Operator group with a service account that has a set of privileges granted to it. The service account sets policy on Operators to ensure they only run within predetermined boundaries by using role-based access control (RBAC) rules. As a result, the Operator is unable to do anything that is not explicitly permitted by those rules.

By employing Operator groups, users with enough privileges can install Operators with a limited scope. As a result, more of the Operator Framework tools can safely be made available to more users, providing a richer experience for building applications with Operators.

[NOTE]
====
Role-based access control (RBAC) for `Subscription` objects is automatically granted to every user with the `edit` or `admin` role in a namespace. However, RBAC does not exist on `OperatorGroup` objects; this absence is what prevents regular users from installing Operators. Pre-installing Operator groups is effectively what gives installation privileges.
====

Keep the following points in mind when associating an Operator group with a service account:

* The `APIService` and `CustomResourceDefinition` resources are always created by OLM using the `cluster-admin` role. A service account associated with an Operator group should never be granted privileges to write these resources.

* Any Operator tied to this Operator group is now confined to the permissions granted to the specified service account. If the Operator asks for permissions that are outside the scope of the service account, the install fails with appropriate errors so the cluster administrator can troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
