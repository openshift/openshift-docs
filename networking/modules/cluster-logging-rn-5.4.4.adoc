== Bug fixes

* Before this update, non-latin characters displayed incorrectly in Elasticsearch. With this update, Elasticsearch displays all valid UTF-8 symbols correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2794[LOG-2794])

* Before this update, non-latin characters displayed incorrectly in Fluentd. With this update, Fluentd displays all valid UTF-8 symbols correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2657[LOG-2657])

* Before this update, the metrics server for the collector attempted to bind to the address using a value exposed by an environment value.  This change modifies the configuration to bind to any available interface. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2821[LOG-2821])

* Before this update, the `cluster-logging` Operator relied on the cluster to create a secret. This cluster behavior changed in {product-title} 4.11, which caused logging deployments to fail. With this update, the `cluster-logging` Operator resolves the issue by creating the secret if needed. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2840[LOG-2840])
