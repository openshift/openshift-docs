= Performing a platform update

You can perform a platform update with the {cgu-operator}.

.Prerequisites

* Install the {cgu-operator-first}.
* Update ZTP to the latest version. 
* Provision one or more managed clusters with ZTP.
* Mirror the desired image repository.
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Create {rh-rhacm} policies in the hub cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a `PolicyGenTemplate` CR for the platform update:
.. Save the following contents of the `PolicyGenTemplate` CR in the `du-upgrade.yaml` file.

<1> The `ConfigMap` CR contains the signature of the desired release image to update to.
<2> Shows the image signature of the desired {product-title} release. Get the signature from the `checksum-${OCP_RELASE_NUMBER}.yaml` file you saved when following the procedures in the "Setting up the environment" section.
<3> Shows the mirror repository that contains the desired {product-title} image. Get the mirrors from the `imageContentSources.yaml` file that you saved when following the procedures in the "Setting up the environment" section.
<4> Shows the `ClusterVersion` CR to update upstream.
<5> Shows the `ClusterVersion` CR to trigger the update. The `channel`, `upstream`, and `desiredVersion` fields are all required for image pre-caching.
+
The `PolicyGenTemplate` CR generates two policies:

* The `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade-prep` policy does the preparation work for the platform update. It creates the `ConfigMap` CR for the desired release image signature, creates the image content source of the mirrored release image repository, and updates the cluster version with the desired update channel and the update graph reachable by the managed cluster in the disconnected environment.

* The `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade` policy is used to perform platform upgrade.

.. Add the `du-upgrade.yaml` file contents to the `kustomization.yaml` file located in the ZTP Git repository for the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs and push the changes to the Git repository.
+
ArgoCD pulls the changes from the Git repository and generates the policies on the hub cluster.

.. Check the created policies by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies -A | grep platform-upgrade
----

. Apply the required update resources before starting the platform update with the {cgu-operator}.

.. Save the content of the `platform-upgrade-prep` `ClusterUpgradeGroup` CR with the `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade-prep` policy and the target managed clusters to the `cgu-platform-upgrade-prep.yml` file, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-platform-upgrade-prep
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade-prep
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 1
  enable: true
----

.. Apply the policy to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-platform-upgrade-prep.yml
----

.. Monitor the update process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
----

. Create the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR for the platform update with the `spec.enable` field set to `false`.

.. Save the content of the platform update `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR with the `du-upgrade-platform-upgrade` policy and the target clusters to the `cgu-platform-upgrade.yml` file, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: ran.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterGroupUpgrade
metadata:
  name: cgu-platform-upgrade
  namespace: default
spec:
  managedPolicies:
  - du-upgrade-platform-upgrade
  preCaching: false
  clusters:
  - spoke1
  remediationStrategy:
    maxConcurrency: 1
  enable: false
----

.. Apply the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR to the hub cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f cgu-platform-upgrade.yml
----

. Optional: Pre-cache the images for the platform update.
.. Enable pre-caching in the `ClusterGroupUpdate` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-platform-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"preCaching": true}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the update process and wait for the pre-caching to complete. Check the status of pre-caching by running the following command on the hub cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get cgu cgu-platform-upgrade -o jsonpath='{.status.precaching.status}'
----

. Start the platform update:
.. Enable the `cgu-platform-upgrade` policy and disable pre-caching by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace=default patch clustergroupupgrade.ran.openshift.io/cgu-platform-upgrade \
--patch '{"spec":{"enable":true, "preCaching": false}}' --type=merge
----

.. Monitor the process. Upon completion, ensure that the policy is compliant by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get policies --all-namespaces
