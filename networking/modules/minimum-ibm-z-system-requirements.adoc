[id="minimum-ibm-z-system-requirements_{context}"]
= Minimum {ibmzProductName} system environment

You can install {product-title} version {product-version} on the following IBM hardware:

* IBM z16 (all models), IBM z15 (all models), IBM z14 (all models), IBM z13, and IBM z13s
* IBM LinuxONE Emperor 4, IBM LinuxONE III (all models), IBM LinuxONE Emperor II, IBM LinuxONE Rockhopper II, IBM LinuxONE Emperor, and IBM LinuxONE Rockhopper

[NOTE]
====
Support for {op-system} functionality for IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, and LinuxONE Rockhopper is deprecated. These hardware models remain fully supported in {product-title} 4.12. However, Red Hat recommends that you use later hardware models.

== Hardware requirements

* The equivalent of six Integrated Facilities for Linux (IFL), which are SMT2 enabled, for each cluster.
* At least one network connection to both connect to the `LoadBalancer` service and to serve data for traffic outside the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You can use dedicated or shared IFLs to assign sufficient compute resources. Resource sharing is one of the key strengths of {ibmzProductName}. However, you must adjust capacity correctly on each hypervisor layer and ensure sufficient resources for every {product-title} cluster.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since the overall performance of the cluster can be impacted, the LPARs that are used to set up the {product-title} clusters must provide sufficient compute capacity. In this context, LPAR weight management, entitlements, and CPU shares on the hypervisor level play an important role.
====

[discrete]
== Operating system requirements

* One instance of z/VM 7.1 or later

On your z/VM instance, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* Two guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
== {ibmzProductName} network connectivity requirements

To install on {ibmzProductName} under z/VM, you require a single z/VM virtual NIC in layer 2 mode. You also need:

*   A direct-attached OSA or RoCE network adapter
*   A z/VM VSwitch set up. For a preferred setup, use OSA link aggregation.

[discrete]
=== Disk storage for the z/VM guest virtual machines

* FICON attached disk storage (DASDs). These can be z/VM minidisks, fullpack minidisks, or dedicated DASDs, all of which must be formatted as CDL, which is the default. To reach the minimum required DASD size for {op-system-first} installations, you need extended address volumes (EAV). If available, use HyperPAV to ensure optimal performance.
* FCP attached disk storage

[discrete]
=== Storage / Main Memory

* 16 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 8 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
