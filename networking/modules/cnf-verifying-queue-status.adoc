= Verifying the queue status

In this section, a number of examples illustrate different performance profiles and how to verify the changes are applied.

.Example 1

In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported devices.

The relevant section from the performance profile is:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  spec:
    cpu:
      reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
      isolated: 2-8
    net:
      userLevelNetworking: true
# ...
----

* Display the status of the queues associated with a device using the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
Run this command on the node where the performance profile was applied.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l <device>
----

* Verify the queue status before the profile is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l ens4
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Channel parameters for ens4:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:         0
TX:         0
Other:      0
Combined:   4
Current hardware settings:
RX:         0
TX:         0
Other:      0
Combined:   4
----

* Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l ens4
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
Channel parameters for ens4:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:         0
TX:         0
Other:      0
Combined:   4
Current hardware settings:
RX:         0
TX:         0
Other:      0
Combined:   2 <1>
----

<1> The combined channel shows that the total count of reserved CPUs for _all_ supported devices is 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.

.Example 2

In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported network devices with a specific `vendorID`.

The relevant section from the performance profile is:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
  spec:
    cpu:
      reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
      isolated: 2-8
    net:
      userLevelNetworking: true
      devices:
      - vendorID = 0x1af4
# ...
----

* Display the status of the queues associated with a device using the following command:
+
[NOTE]
====
Run this command on the node where the performance profile was applied.
====
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l <device>
----

* Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l ens4
----

Channel parameters for ens4:
Pre-set maximums:
RX:         0
TX:         0

TX:         0

Combined:   2 <1>
----

<1> The total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices with `vendorID=0x1af4` is 2.
For example, if there is another network device `ens2` with `vendorID=0x1af4` it will also have total net queues of 2. This matches what is configured in the performance profile.

.Example 3

In this example, the net queue count is set to the reserved CPU count (2) for _all_ supported network devices that match any of the defined device identifiers.

The command `udevadm info` provides a detailed report on a device. In this example the devices are:

[source,terminal]
----
# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/ens4
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1000
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1af4
E: INTERFACE=ens4
...
----

[source,terminal]
----
# udevadm info -p /sys/class/net/eth0
...
E: ID_MODEL_ID=0x1002
E: ID_VENDOR_ID=0x1001
E: INTERFACE=eth0
...
----

* Set the net queues to 2 for a device with `interfaceName` equal to `eth0` and any devices that have a `vendorID=0x1af4` with the following performance profile:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
metadata:
  name: performance
spec:
  kind: PerformanceProfile
    spec:
      cpu:
        reserved: 0-1  #total = 2
        isolated: 2-8
      net:
        userLevelNetworking: true
        devices:
        - interfaceName = eth0
        - vendorID = 0x1af4
...
----

* Verify the queue status after the profile is applied:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ethtool -l ens4
----

<1> The total count of reserved CPUs for all supported devices with `vendorID=0x1af4` is set to 2.
For example, if there is another network device `ens2` with `vendorID=0x1af4`, it will also have the total net queues set to 2. Similarly, a device with `interfaceName` equal to `eth0` will have total net queues set to 2.
