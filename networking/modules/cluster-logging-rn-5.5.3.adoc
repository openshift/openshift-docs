== Bug fixes
* Before this update, log entries that had structured messages included the original message field, which made the entry larger. This update removes the message field for structured logs to reduce the increased size. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2759[LOG-2759])

* Before this update, the collector configuration excluded logs from `collector`, `default-log-store`, and `visualization`  pods, but was unable to exclude logs archived in a `.gz` file. With this update, archived logs stored as `.gz` files of `collector`, `default-log-store`, and `visualization` pods are also excluded. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2844[LOG-2844])

* Before this update, when requests to an unavailable pod were sent through the gateway, no alert would warn of the disruption. With this update, individual alerts will generate if the gateway has issues completing a write or read request. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2884[LOG-2884])

* Before this update, pod metadata could be altered by fluent plugins because the values passed through the pipeline by reference. This update ensures each log message receives a copy of the pod metadata so each message processes independently. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3046[LOG-3046])

* Before this update, selecting *unknown* severity in the OpenShift Console Logs view excluded logs with a `level=unknown` value. With this update, logs without level and with `level=unknown` values are visible when filtering by *unknown* severity. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3062[LOG-3062])

* Before this update, log records sent to Elasticsearch had an extra field named `write-index` that contained the name of the index to which the logs needed to be sent. This field is not a part of the data model. After this update, this field is no longer sent. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3075[LOG-3075])

* With the introduction of the new built-in link:https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/pod-security-admission-in-openshift-4.11[Pod Security Admission Controller], Pods not configured in accordance with the enforced security standards defined globally or on the namespace level cannot run. With this update, the Operator and collectors allow privileged execution and run without security audit warnings or errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3077[LOG-3077])

* Before this update, the Operator removed any custom outputs defined in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource when using LokiStack as the default log storage. With this update, the Operator merges custom outputs with the default outputs when processing the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3095[LOG-3095])
