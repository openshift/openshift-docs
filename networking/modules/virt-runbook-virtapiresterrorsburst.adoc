= VirtApiRESTErrorsBurst

[discrete]
[id="meaning-virtapiresterrorsburst_{context}"]
== Meaning

More than 80% of REST calls have failed in the `virt-api` pods in the last
5 minutes.

[discrete]
[id="impact-virtapiresterrorsburst_{context}"]
== Impact

A very high rate of failed REST calls to `virt-api` might lead to slow
response and execution of API calls, and potentially to API calls being
completely dismissed.

However, currently running virtual machine workloads are not likely to
be affected.

== Diagnosis

. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A \
  -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
----

. Obtain the list of `virt-api` pods on your deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $NAMESPACE get pods -l kubevirt.io=virt-api
----

. Check the `virt-api` logs for error messages:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs -n $NAMESPACE <virt-api>
----

. Obtain the details of the `virt-api` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe -n $NAMESPACE <virt-api>
----

. Check if any problems occurred with the nodes. For example, they might
be in a `NotReady` state:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----

. Check the status of the `virt-api` deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-api -o yaml
----

. Obtain the details of the `virt-api` deployment:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $NAMESPACE describe deploy virt-api
----
