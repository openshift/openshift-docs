= Volume format
Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it
checks that it contains a file system as specified by the `fsType`
parameter in the persistent volume definition. If the device is not
formatted with the file system, all data from the device is erased and the
device is automatically formatted with the given file system.

This allows using unformatted {provider} volumes as persistent volumes,
because {product-title} formats them before the first use.
