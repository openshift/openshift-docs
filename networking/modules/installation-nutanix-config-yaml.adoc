= Sample customized install-config.yaml file for Nutanix

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your `install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

<1> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<2> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures, the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<3> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or `hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
<4> Optional: Provide additional configuration for the machine pool parameters for the compute and control plane machines.
<5> The cluster network plugin to install. The supported values are `OVNKubernetes` and `OpenShiftSDN`. The default value is `OVNKubernetes`.
ifndef::openshift-origin[]
<6> Optional: By default, the installation program downloads and installs the {op-system-first} image. If Prism Central does not have internet access, you can override the default behavior by hosting the {op-system} image on any HTTP server and pointing the installation program to the image.
<7> Whether to enable or disable FIPS mode. By default, FIPS mode is not enabled. If FIPS mode is enabled, the {op-system-first} machines that {product-title} runs on bypass the default Kubernetes cryptography suite and use the cryptography modules that are provided with {op-system} instead.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of FIPS Validated or Modules in Process cryptographic libraries is only supported on {product-title} deployments on the `x86_64` architecture.
====
<8> Optional: You can provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.

<6> Optional: By default, the installation program downloads and installs the {op-system-first} image. If Prism Central does not have internet access, you can override the default behavior by hosting the {op-system} image on any HTTP server and pointing the installation program to the image.
<7> Optional: You can provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
endif::openshift-origin[]
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, specify an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses.
