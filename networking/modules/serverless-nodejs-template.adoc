= Node.js function template structure

When you create a Node.js function using the Knative (`kn`) CLI, the project directory looks like a typical Node.js project. The only exception is the additional `func.yaml` file, which is used to configure the function.

Both `http` and `event` trigger functions have the same template structure:

.Template structure
[source,terminal]
----
.
├── func.yaml <1>
├── index.js <2>
├── package.json <3>
├── README.md
└── test <4>
    ├── integration.js
    └── unit.js
----
<1> The `func.yaml` configuration file is used to determine the image name and registry.
<2> Your project must contain an `index.js` file which exports a single function.
<3> You are not restricted to the dependencies provided in the template `package.json` file. You can add additional dependencies as you would in any other Node.js project.

.Example of adding npm dependencies
[source,terminal]
----
npm install --save opossum

When the project is built for deployment, these dependencies are included in the created runtime container image.
<4> Integration and unit test scripts are provided as part of the function template.
