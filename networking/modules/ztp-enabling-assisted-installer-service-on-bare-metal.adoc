= Enabling the assisted service and updating AgentServiceConfig on the hub cluster

{rh-rhacm-first} uses the assisted service to deploy {product-title} clusters. The assisted service is deployed automatically when you enable the MultiClusterHub Operator with Central Infrastructure Management (CIM). When you have enabled CIM on the hub cluster, you then need to update the `AgentServiceConfig` custom resource (CR) with references to the ISO and RootFS images that are hosted on the mirror registry HTTP server.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You have enabled the assisted service on the hub cluster. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.6/html/multicluster_engine/multicluster_engine_overview#enable-cim[Enabling CIM].

.Procedure

. Update the `AgentServiceConfig` CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit AgentServiceConfig
----

. Add the following entry to the `items.spec.osImages` field in the CR:
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
- cpuArchitecture: x86_64
    openshiftVersion: "{product-version}"
    rootFSUrl: https://<host>/<path>/rhcos-live-rootfs.x86_64.img
    url: https://<mirror-registry>/<path>/rhcos-live.x86_64.iso
----
+
where:
+
--
<host> :: Is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the target mirror registry HTTP server.
<path> :: Is the path to the image on the target mirror registry.
--
+
Save and quit the editor to apply the changes.
