= Creating a Linux bridge network attachment definition in the web console

Network administrators can create network attachment definitions to provide layer-2 networking to pods and virtual machines.

.Procedure

. In the web console, click *Networking* -> *Network Attachment Definitions*.
. Click *Create Network Attachment Definition*.
+
[NOTE]
====
The network attachment definition must be in the same namespace as the pod or virtual machine.
====
+
. Enter a unique *Name* and optional *Description*.
. Click the *Network Type* list and select *CNV Linux bridge*.
. Enter the name of the bridge in the *Bridge Name* field.
. Optional: If the resource has VLAN IDs configured, enter the ID numbers in the *VLAN Tag Number* field.
. Optional: Select *MAC Spoof Check* to enable MAC spoof filtering. This feature provides security against a MAC spoofing attack by allowing only a single MAC address to exit the pod.
. Click *Create*.

A Linux bridge network attachment definition is the most efficient method for connecting a virtual machine to a VLAN.
