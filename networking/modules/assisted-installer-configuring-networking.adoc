= Configuring networking

Before installing {product-title}, you must configure the cluster network.

.Procedure

. In the *Networking* page, select one of the following if it is not already selected for you:
+
** *Cluster-Managed Networking:* Selecting cluster-managed networking means that the {ai-full} will configure a standard network topology, including `keepalived` and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for managing the API and Ingress VIP addresses.
+
** *User-Managed Networking*: Selecting user-managed networking allows you to deploy {product-title} with a non-standard network topology. For example, if you want to deploy with an external load balancer instead of `keepalived` and VRRP, or if you intend to deploy the cluster nodes across many distinct L2 network segments.

. For cluster-managed networking, configure the following settings:

.. Define the *Machine network*. You can use the default network or select a subnet.

.. Define an *API virtual IP*. An API virtual IP provides an endpoint for all users to interact with, and configure the platform.

.. Define an *Ingress virtual IP*. An Ingress virtual IP provides an endpoint for application traffic flowing from outside the cluster.

. For user-managed networking, configure the following settings:

.. Select your *Networking stack type*:
+
** *IPv4*: Select this type when your hosts are only using IPv4.
+
** *Dual-stack*: You can select dual-stack when your hosts are using IPv4 together with IPv6.

.. Define the *Machine network*. You can use the default network or select a subnet.

.. Define an *API virtual IP*. An API virtual IP provides an endpoint for all users to interact with, and configure the platform.

.. Define an *Ingress virtual IP*. An Ingress virtual IP provides an endpoint for application traffic flowing from outside the cluster.

.. Optional: You can select *Allocate IPs via DHCP server* to automatically allocate the *API IP* and *Ingress IP* using the DHCP server.

. Optional: Select *Use advanced networking* to configure the following advanced networking properties:

** *Cluster network CIDR*: Define an IP address block from which Pod IP addresses are allocated.

** *Cluster network host prefix*: Define a subnet prefix length to assign to each node.

** *Service network CIDR*: Define an IP address to use for service IP addresses.

** *Network type*: Select either *Software-Defined Networking (SDN)* for standard networking or *Open Virtual Networking (OVN)* for telco features.
