= {sno-caps} differences

You can install {VirtProductName} on a single-node cluster.

When provisioning a {sno} cluster with the assisted installer, preconfigured persistent storage is deployed automatically.

* In {VirtProductName} 4.10 and 4.11, the HostPath Provisioner (HPP) is automatically installed.
* In {VirtProductName} 4.12, the OpenShift Data Foundation Logical Volume Manager Operator is the provided out-of-the-box storage solution. You can also manually deploy using the HPP.

[NOTE]
====
{sno-caps} does not support high availability. Be aware of the following differences in functionality from a multiple-node cluster:

* Pod disruption budgets are not supported.
* Live migration is not supported.
* Due to differences in storage behavior, some virtual machine templates are incompatible with {sno}. To ensure compatibility,  templates or virtual machines that use data volumes or storage profiles must not have the eviction strategy set.
