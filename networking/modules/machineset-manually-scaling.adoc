= Scaling a compute machine set manually

To add or remove an instance of a machine in a compute machine set, you can manually scale the compute machine set.

This guidance is relevant to fully automated, installer-provisioned infrastructure installations. Customized, user-provisioned infrastructure installations do not have compute machine sets.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the compute machine sets that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The compute machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. View the compute machines that are in the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Set the annotation on the compute machine that you want to delete by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name> -n openshift-machine-api machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----

. Cordon and drain the node that you want to delete by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm cordon <node_name>
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm drain <node_name>
----

. Scale the compute machine set by running one of the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
Or:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can alternatively apply the following YAML to scale the compute machine set:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machineset>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
----
====
+
You can scale the compute machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.

.Verification

* Verify the deletion of the intended machine by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get machines
----
