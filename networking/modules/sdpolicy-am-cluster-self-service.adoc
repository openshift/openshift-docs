= Cluster self-service

Customers can create, scale, and delete their clusters from {cluster-manager-url}, provided that they have already purchased the necessary subscriptions.

Actions available in {cluster-manager-first} must not be directly performed from within the cluster as this might cause adverse affects, including having all actions automatically reverted.
