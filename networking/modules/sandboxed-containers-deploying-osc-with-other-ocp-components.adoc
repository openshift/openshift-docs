= Virtualization and {sandboxed-containers-first}
//= Using {sandboxed-containers-first} with other {product-title} components

You can use {sandboxed-containers-first} on clusters with {VirtProductName}.

To run {VirtProductName} and {sandboxed-containers-first} at the same time, you must enable VMs to migrate, so that they do not block node reboots. Configure the following parameters on your VM:

* Use `ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd` as the storage class.
* Set the `evictionStrategy` parameter to `LiveMigrate` in the VM.
