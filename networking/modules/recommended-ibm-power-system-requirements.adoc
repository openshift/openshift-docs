= Recommended IBM Power system requirements

[discrete]
== Hardware requirements

* Six IBM Power bare metal servers or six LPARs across multiple PowerVM servers

[discrete]
== Operating system requirements

* One instance of an IBM Power9 or Power10 processor-based system

On your IBM Power instance, set up:

* Three guest virtual machines for {product-title} control plane machines
* Two guest virtual machines for {product-title} compute machines
* One guest virtual machine for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine

[discrete]
== Disk storage for the IBM Power guest virtual machines

* Local storage, or storage provisioned by the Virtual I/O Server using vSCSI, NPIV (N-Port ID Virtualization) or SSP (shared storage pools)

[discrete]
== Network for the PowerVM guest virtual machines

* Dedicated physical adapter, or SR-IOV virtual function
* Available by the Virtual I/O Server using Shared Ethernet Adapter
* Virtualized by the Virtual I/O Server using IBM vNIC

[discrete]
== Storage / main memory

* 120 GB / 32 GB for {product-title} control plane machines
* 120 GB / 32 GB for {product-title} compute machines
* 120 GB / 16 GB for the temporary {product-title} bootstrap machine
