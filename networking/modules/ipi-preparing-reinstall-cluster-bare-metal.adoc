= Preparing to reinstall a cluster on bare metal
Before you reinstall a cluster on bare metal, you must perform cleanup operations.

.Procedure
. Remove or reformat the disks for the bootstrap, control plane node, and worker nodes. If you are working in a hypervisor environment, you must add any disks you removed.
. Delete the artifacts that the previous installation generated:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd ; /bin/rm -rf auth/ bootstrap.ign master.ign worker.ign metadata.json \
.openshift_install.log .openshift_install_state.json
----
. Generate new manifests and Ignition config files. See â€œCreating the Kubernetes manifest and Ignition config files" for more information.
. Upload the new bootstrap, control plane, and compute node Ignition config files that the installation program created to your HTTP server. This will overwrite the previous Ignition files.
