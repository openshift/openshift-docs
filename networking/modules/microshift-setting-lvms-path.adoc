= Setting the LVMS path

The `config.yaml` file for the LMVS should be written to the same directory as the {product-title} `config.yaml` file. If a {product-title} `config.yaml` file does not exist, {product-title} will create an LVMS YAML and automatically populate the configuration fields with the default settings. The following paths are checked for the `config.yaml` file, depending on which user runs {product-title}:

.LVMS paths
[options="header",cols="1,3"]
|===
|{product-title} user | Configuration directory
|Global administrator | `/etc/microshift/lvmd.yaml`
|===
