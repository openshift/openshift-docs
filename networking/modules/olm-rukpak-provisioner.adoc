= Provisioner

A RukPak provisioner is a controller that understands the `BundleDeployment` and `Bundle` APIs and can take action. Each provisioner is assigned a unique ID and is responsible for reconciling `Bundle` and `BundleDeployment` objects with a `spec.provisionerClassName` field that matches that particular ID.

For example, the plain provisioner is able to unpack a given `plain+v0` bundle onto a cluster and then instantiate it, making the content of the bundle available in the cluster.
