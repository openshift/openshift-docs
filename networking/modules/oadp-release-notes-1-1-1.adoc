= OADP 1.1.1 release notes

The OADP 1.1.1 release notes include product recommendations and descriptions of known issues.

== Product recommendations

Before you install OADP 1.1.1, it is recommended to either install VolSync 0.5.1 or to upgrade to it.

== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* OADP currently does not support backup and restore of AWS EFS volumes using restic in Velero (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-778[*OADP-778*]).

* CSI backups might fail due to a Ceph limitation of `VolumeSnapshotContent` snapshots per PVC.
+
You can create many snapshots of the same persistent volume claim (PVC) but cannot schedule periodic creation of snapshots:
+
** For CephFS, you can create up to 100 snapshots per PVC.
** For RADOS Block Device (RBD), you can create up to 512 snapshots for each PVC. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-804[*OADP-804*]) and (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-975[*OADP-975*])
