[id="microshift-certificate-lifetime_{context}"]
= Security certificate lifetime

{product-title} certificates are separated into two basic groups:

. Short-lived certificates having certificate validity of one year.
. Long-lived certificates having certificate validity of 10 years.

Most server or leaf certificates are short-lived.

An example of a long-lived certificate is the client certificate for `system:admin user` authentication, or the certificate of the signer of the `kube-apiserver` external serving certificate.

[id="microshift-certificate-rotation_{context}"]
== Certificate rotation
As certificates age, {product-title} can be restarted to rotate certificates. A certificate that is close to expiring might also automatically cause a restart. Read the following situation overviews to understand the actions at each moment in time:

. Green zone:
.. When a short-term certificate is 5 months old, no rotation occurs.
.. When a long-term certificate is 8.5 years old, no rotation occurs.

. Yellow zone:
.. When a short-term certificate is 8 months old, it is rotated when {product-title} starts or restarts.
.. When a long-term certificate is 9 years old, it is rotated when {product-title} starts or restarts.

. Red zone
.. When a short-term certificate is 8 months old, {product-title} restarts to rotate and apply a new certificate.
.. When a long-term certificate is 9 years old, {product-title} restarts to rotate and apply a new certificate.

[NOTE]
====
If the rotated certificate is a Certificate Authority, all of the certificates it signed rotate.
