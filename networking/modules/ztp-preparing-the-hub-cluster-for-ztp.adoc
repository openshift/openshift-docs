= Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD

You can configure the hub cluster with a set of ArgoCD applications that generate the required installation and policy custom resources (CRs) for each site with GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP).

[NOTE]
====
{rh-rhacm-first} uses `SiteConfig` CRs to generate the Day 1 managed cluster installation CRs for ArgoCD. Each ArgoCD application can manage a maximum of 300 `SiteConfig` CRs.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have a {product-title} hub cluster with {rh-rhacm-first} and {gitops-title} installed.

* You have extracted the reference deployment from the ZTP GitOps plugin container as described in the "Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository" section. Extracting the reference deployment creates the `out/argocd/deployment` directory referenced in the following procedure.

.Procedure

. Prepare the ArgoCD pipeline configuration:

.. Create a Git repository with the directory structure similar to the example directory. For more information, see "Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository".

.. Configure access to the repository using the ArgoCD UI. Under *Settings* configure the following:

*** *Repositories* - Add the connection information. The URL must end in `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git` and credentials.

*** *Certificates* - Add the public certificate for the repository, if needed.

.. Modify the two ArgoCD applications, `out/argocd/deployment/clusters-app.yaml` and `out/argocd/deployment/policies-app.yaml`, based on your Git repository:

*** Update the URL to point to the Git repository. The URL ends with `.git`, for example, `https://repo.example.com/repo.git`.

*** The `targetRevision` indicates which Git repository branch to monitor.

*** `path` specifies the path to the `SiteConfig` and `PolicyGenTemplate` CRs, respectively.

. To install the ZTP GitOps plugin you must patch the ArgoCD instance in the hub cluster by using the patch file previously extracted into the `out/argocd/deployment/` directory. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch argocd openshift-gitops \ 
-n openshift-gitops --type=merge \ 
--patch-file out/argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json
----

. Apply the pipeline configuration to your hub cluster by using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -k out/argocd/deployment
----
