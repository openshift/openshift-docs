= Starting pipelines from Topology view

For pipelines created using the *From Git* option, you can use the *Topology* view to interact with pipelines after you start them:

[NOTE]
====
To see the pipelines created using the *Pipeline Builder* in the *Topology* view, customize the pipeline labels to link the pipeline with the application workload.
====
.Procedure

. Click *Topology* in the left navigation panel.
. Click the application to display *Pipeline Runs* in the side panel.
. In *Pipeline Runs*, click *Start Last Run* to start a new pipeline run with the same parameters and resources as the previous one. This option is disabled if a pipeline run has not been initiated. You can also start a pipeline run when you create it.

In the *Topology* page, hover to the left of the application to see the status of its pipeline run. After a pipeline is added, a bottom left icon indicates that there is an associated pipeline.
