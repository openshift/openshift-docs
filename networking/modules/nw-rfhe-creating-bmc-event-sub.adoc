= Subscribing to bare-metal events

You can configure the baseboard management controller (BMC) to send bare-metal events to subscribed applications running in an {product-title} cluster. Example Redfish bare-metal events include an increase in device temperature, or removal of a device. You subscribe applications to bare-metal events using a REST API.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only create a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for physical hardware that supports Redfish and has a vendor interface set to `redfish` or `idrac-redfish`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Use the `BMCEventSubscription` CR to subscribe to predefined Redfish events. The Redfish standard does not provide an option to create specific alerts and thresholds. For example, to receive an alert event when an enclosure's temperature exceeds 40° Celsius, you must manually configure the event according to the vendor's recommendations.
====

Perform the following procedure to subscribe to bare-metal events for the node using a `BMCEventSubscription` CR.

.Prerequisites
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* Get the user name and password for the BMC.
* Deploy a bare-metal node with a Redfish-enabled Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) in your cluster, and enable Redfish events on the BMC.
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling Redfish events on specific hardware is outside the scope of this information. For more information about enabling Redfish events for your specific hardware, consult the BMC manufacturer documentation.
====

.Procedure
. Confirm that the node hardware has the Redfish `EventService` enabled by running the following `curl` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
curl https://<bmc_ip_address>/redfish/v1/EventService --insecure -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u "<bmc_username>:<password>"
----
+
where:
+
--
bmc_ip_address:: is the IP address of the BMC where the Redfish events are generated.
--
+

$ oc get route -n openshift-bare-metal-events

. Create a `BMCEventSubscription` resource to subscribe to the Redfish events:

.. Save the following YAML in the `bmc_sub.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1
kind: BMCEventSubscription
metadata:
  name: sub-01
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
   hostName: <hostname> <1>
   destination: <proxy_service_url> <2>
   context: ''
----
<1> Specifies the name or UUID of the worker node where the Redfish events are generated.
<2> Specifies the bare-metal event proxy service, for example, `https://hw-event-proxy-openshift-bare-metal-events.apps.compute-1.example.com/webhook`.

.. Create the `BMCEventSubscription` CR:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f bmc_sub.yaml
----

. Optional: To delete the BMC event subscription, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f bmc_sub.yaml
----

. Optional: To manually create a Redfish event subscription without creating a `BMCEventSubscription` CR, run the following `curl` command, specifying the BMC username and password.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -i -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"Destination": "https://<proxy_service_url>", "Protocol" : "Redfish", "EventTypes": ["Alert"], "Context": "root"}' -u <bmc_username>:<password> 'https://<bmc_ip_address>/redfish/v1/EventService/Subscriptions' –v
----
+
where:
+
--
proxy_service_url:: is the bare-metal event proxy service, for example, `https://hw-event-proxy-openshift-bare-metal-events.apps.compute-1.example.com/webhook`.
--
+
--
bmc_ip_address:: is the IP address of the BMC where the Redfish events are generated.
