= About top consumers for projects, virtual machines, and nodes

The *Top Consumers* cards display projects, virtual machines or nodes with maximum consumption of a resource. You can select a project, a virtual machine, or a node and view the top five or top ten consumers of a specific resource.

[NOTE]
====
Viewing the maximum resource consumption is limited to the top five or top ten consumers within each *Top Consumers* card.
====

The following table shows resources monitored for top consumers.

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Resources monitored for top consumption* | *Description*
|CPU
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most CPU.
|Memory
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most memory (in bytes). The unit of display (for example, MiB or GiB) is determined by the size of the resource consumption.
|Used filesystem
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest consumption of filesystems (in bytes). The unit of display (for example, MiB or GiB) is determined by the size of the resource consumption.
|Memory swap
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes consuming the most memory pressure when memory is swapped .
|vCPU wait
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes experiencing the maximum wait time (in seconds) for the vCPUs.
|Storage throughput
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest data transfer rate to and from the storage media (in mbps).
|Storage IOPS
|Projects, virtual machines, or nodes with the highest amount of storage IOPS (input/output operations per second) over a time period.
