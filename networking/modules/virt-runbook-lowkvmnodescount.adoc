= LowKVMNodesCount

[discrete]
[id="meaning-lowkvmnodescount_{context}"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when fewer than two nodes in the cluster have KVM resources.

[discrete]
[id="impact-lowkvmnodescount_{context}"]
== Impact

The cluster must have at least two nodes with KVM resources for live migration.

Virtual machines cannot be scheduled or run if no nodes have KVM resources.

[id="diagnosis-lowkvmnodescount_{context}"]
== Diagnosis

* Identify the nodes with KVM resources:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.allocatable}' | \
  grep devices.kubevirt.io/kvm
----

[discrete]
[id="mitigation-lowkvmnodescount_{context}"]
== Mitigation

Install KVM on the nodes without KVM resources.
