= High availability For ingressIP

In non-cloud clusters, IP failover and `ingressIP` to a service can be combined. The result is high availability services for users that create services using `ingressIP`.

The approach is to specify an `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` range and then use the same range in creating the ipfailover configuration.

Because IP failover can support up to a maximum of 255 VIPs for the entire cluster, the `ingressIPNetworkCIDR` needs to be `/24` or smaller.
