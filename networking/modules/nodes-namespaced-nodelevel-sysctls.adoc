= Namespaced and node-level sysctls

A number of sysctls are _namespaced_ in the Linux kernels. This means that you can set them independently for each pod on a node. Being namespaced is a requirement for sysctls to be accessible in a pod context within Kubernetes.

The following sysctls are known to be namespaced:

- `_kernel.shm*_`
- `_kernel.msg*_`
- `_kernel.sem_`
- `_fs.mqueue.*_`

Additionally, most of the sysctls in the `net.*` group are known to be namespaced. Their namespace adoption differs based on the kernel version and distributor.

Sysctls that are not namespaced are called _node-level_ and must be set
manually by the cluster administrator, either by means of the underlying Linux
distribution of the nodes, such as by modifying the `_/etc/sysctls.conf_` file,
or by using a daemon set with privileged containers. You can use the Node Tuning Operator to set _node-level_ sysctls.


[NOTE]
====
Consider marking nodes with special sysctls as tainted. Only schedule pods onto
them that need those sysctl settings. Use the taints and toleration feature to mark the nodes.
