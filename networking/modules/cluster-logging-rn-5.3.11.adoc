== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the Operator did not ensure that the pod was ready, which caused the cluster to reach an inoperable state during a cluster restart. With this update, the Operator marks new pods as ready before continuing to a new pod during a restart, which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2871[LOG-2871])
