= {op-system} extensions

The {sandboxed-containers-operator} is based on the {op-system-first} extensions concept. {op-system-first} extensions are a mechanism to install optional {product-title} software. The {sandboxed-containers-operator} uses this mechanism to deploy sandboxed containers on a cluster.

The sandboxed containers {op-system} extension contains RPMs for Kata, QEMU, and its dependencies. You can enable them by using the `MachineConfig` resources that the Machine Config Operator provides.
