== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the Operator did not ensure that the pod was ready, which caused the cluster to reach an inoperable state during a cluster restart. With this update, the Operator marks new pods as ready before continuing to a new pod during a restart, which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2881[LOG-2881])

* Before this update, the addition of multi-line error detection caused internal routing to change and forward records to the wrong destination. With this update, the internal routing is correct. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2946[LOG-2946])

* Before this update, the Operator could not decode index setting JSON responses with a quoted Boolean value and would result in an error. With this update, the Operator can properly decode this JSON response. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3009[LOG-3009])

* Before this update, Elasticsearch index templates defined the fields for labels with the wrong types. This change updates those templates to match the expected types forwarded by the log collector. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2972[LOG-2972])
