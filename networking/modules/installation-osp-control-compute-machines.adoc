[id="installation-osp-control-machines_{context}"]
= Control plane machines

By default, the {product-title} installation process creates three control
plane machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 16 GB memory and 4 vCPUs
* At least 100 GB storage space from the {rh-openstack} quota

[id="installation-osp-compute-machines_{context}"]
= Compute machines

By default, the {product-title} installation process creates three compute
machines.

Each machine requires:

* An instance from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A port from the {rh-openstack} quota
* A flavor with at least 8 GB memory and 2 vCPUs
* At least 100 GB storage space from the {rh-openstack} quota

[TIP]
====
Compute machines host the applications that you run on {product-title}; aim to
run as many as you can.
====

ifdef::osp-sr-iov[]
Additionally, for clusters that use single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV), {rh-openstack} compute nodes require a flavor that supports link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.1/html/configuring_the_compute_service_for_instance_creation/assembly_configuring-compute-nodes-for-performance_compute-performance#proc_configuring-huge-pages-on-compute-nodes_compute-performance[huge pages].

[IMPORTANT]
====
SR-IOV deployments often employ performance optimizations, such as dedicated or isolated CPUs. For maximum performance, configure your underlying {rh-openstack} deployment to use these optimizations, and then run {product-title} compute machines on the optimized infrastructure.
