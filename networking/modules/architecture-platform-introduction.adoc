= Introduction to {product-title}

{product-title} is a platform for developing and running containerized
applications. It is designed to allow applications and the data centers
that support them to expand from just a few machines and applications to
thousands of machines that serve millions of clients.

With its foundation in Kubernetes, {product-title} incorporates the same
technology that serves as the engine for massive telecommunications, streaming
video, gaming, banking, and other applications. Its implementation in open
Red Hat technologies lets you extend your containerized applications beyond a
single cloud to on-premise and multi-cloud environments.

// The architecture presented here is meant to give you insights into how {product-title} works. It does this by stepping you through the process of installing an {product-title} cluster, managing the cluster, and developing and deploying applications on it. Along the way, this architecture describes:

// * Major components of  {product-title}
// * Ways of exploring different aspects of {product-title} yourself
// * Available frontdoors (and backdoors) to modify the installation and management of your {product-title} cluster
// * Different types of container application types
