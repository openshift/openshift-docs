= Isolating containers with multitenancy

Multitenancy allows applications on an {product-title} cluster that are owned
by multiple users, and run across multiple hosts and namespaces,
to remain isolated from each other and from outside attacks.
You obtain multitenancy by applying role-based access control (RBAC)
to Kubernetes namespaces.

In Kubernetes, _namespaces_ are areas where applications can run
in ways that are separate from other applications.
{product-title} uses and extends namespaces by adding extra
annotations, including MCS labeling in SELinux, and identifying
these extended namespaces as _projects_. Within the scope of
a project, users can maintain their own cluster resources,
including service accounts, policies, constraints,
and various other objects.

RBAC objects are assigned to projects to authorize selected users
to have access to those projects. That authorization takes the form
of rules, roles, and bindings:

* Rules define what a user can create or access in a project.
* Roles are collections of rules that you can bind to selected users or groups.
* Bindings define the association between users or groups and roles. 

Local RBAC roles and bindings attach a user or group to a
particular project. Cluster RBAC can attach cluster-wide roles and bindings
to all projects in a cluster. There are default
cluster roles that can be assigned to provide `admin`, `basic-user`, `cluster-admin`,
and `cluster-status` access.
