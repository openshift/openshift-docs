= Installing the Kubernetes Collection for Ansible

You can install the Kubernetes Collection for Ansible on your local workstation.

.Procedure

. Install Ansible 2.9+:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo dnf install ansible
----

. Install the link:https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python[OpenShift python client] package:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ pip3 install openshift
----

. Install the Kubernetes Collection using one of the following methods:

* You can install the collection directly from Ansible Galaxy:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes
----

* If you have already initialized your Operator, you might have a `requirements.yml` file at the top level of your project. This file specifies Ansible dependencies that must be installed for your Operator to function. By default, this file installs the `community.kubernetes` collection as well as the `operator_sdk.util` collection, which provides modules and plugins for Operator-specific fuctions.
+
To install the dependent modules from the `requirements.yml` file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----
