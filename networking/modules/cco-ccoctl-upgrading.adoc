[id="cco-ccoctl-upgrading_{context}"]
= Updating cloud provider resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

The process for upgrading an {product-title} cluster configured for 
ifdef::aws-sts[manual mode with STS]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[manual mode with GCP Workload Identity]
is similar to creating the cloud provider resources during installation.

[NOTE]
====
By default, `ccoctl` creates objects in the directory in which the commands are run. To create the objects in a different directory, use the `--output-dir` flag. This procedure uses `<path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>` to refer to this directory.
ifdef::aws-sts[]

Some `ccoctl` commands make AWS API calls to create or modify AWS resources. You can use the `--dry-run` flag to avoid making API calls. Using this flag creates JSON files on the local file system instead. You can review and modify the JSON files and then apply them with the AWS CLI tool using the `--cli-input-json` parameters.

====

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} release image for the version that you are upgrading to.

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary from the release image.

.Procedure

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract --credentials-requests \
ifdef::aws-sts[--cloud=aws \]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[--cloud=gcp \]
--to=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests \ <1>
quay.io/<path_to>/ocp-release:<version>
----
+
<1> `credrequests` is the directory where the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects is stored. This command creates the directory if it does not exist.

. For each `CredentialsRequest` CR in the release image, ensure that a namespace that matches the text in the `spec.secretRef.namespace` field exists in the cluster. This field is where the generated secrets that hold the credentials configuration are stored.

<1> This field indicates the namespace which needs to exist to hold the generated secret.

. For any `CredentialsRequest` CR for which the cluster does not already have a namespace with the name specified in `spec.secretRef.namespace`, create the namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace <component_namespace>
----

. Use the `ccoctl` tool to process all `CredentialsRequest` objects in the `credrequests` directory by running the following command:
+
ifdef::aws-sts[]
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws create-iam-roles \

** `<name>` is the name used to tag any cloud resources that are created for tracking. For upgrades, use the same value that was used for the initial installation.
** `<aws_account_id>` is the AWS account ID.
** `<aws_region>` is the AWS region in which cloud resources will be created.
** `<aws_account_id>`, `<cluster_name>`, and `<aws_region>` are standard elements of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your cluster, provided here to illustrate the format of an ARN. You can obtain the ARN for your cluster's identity provider from the *Identity Providers* menu in the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/[AWS IAM console]. 
--
+
[NOTE]
====
For AWS environments that use alternative IAM API endpoints, such as GovCloud, you must also specify your region with the `--region` parameter.

If your cluster uses Technology Preview features that are enabled by the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set, you must include the `--enable-tech-preview` parameter.

** `<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests` is the directory containing the files of `CredentialsRequest` manifests to create GCP service accounts.

endif::google-cloud-platform[]

For each `CredentialsRequest` object, `ccoctl` creates 
ifdef::aws-sts[an IAM role with a trust policy that is tied to the specified OIDC identity provider,]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[a service account]
and a permissions policy as defined in each `CredentialsRequest` object from the {product-title} release image.

. Apply the secrets to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ls <path_to_ccoctl_output_dir>/manifests/*-credentials.yaml | xargs -I{} oc apply -f {}
----

.Verification

You can verify that the 
ifdef::aws-sts[IAM roles]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[service accounts]
are created by querying 
ifdef::aws-sts[AWS.]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[GCP.]
For more information, refer to 
ifdef::aws-sts[AWS]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[GCP]
documentation on listing 
ifdef::aws-sts[IAM roles.]
ifdef::google-cloud-platform[service accounts.]
