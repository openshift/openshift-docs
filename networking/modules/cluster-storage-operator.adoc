[NOTE]
====
The Cluster Storage Operator is an optional cluster capability that can be disabled by cluster administrators during installation. For more information about optional cluster capabilities, see "Cluster capabilities" in _Installing_.

== Purpose

ifdef::cluster-caps[]

The Cluster Storage Operator provides the features for the `Storage` capability.

endif::cluster-caps[]

The Cluster Storage Operator sets {product-title} cluster-wide storage defaults. It ensures a default `storageclass` exists for {product-title} clusters. It also installs Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers which enable your cluster to use various storage backends. 

ifdef::cluster-caps[]
[IMPORTANT]
====
If the cluster storage capability is disabled, the cluster will not have a default `storageclass` or any CSI drivers. Users with administrator privileges can create a default `storageclass` and manually install CSI drivers if the cluster storage capability is disabled.

== Notes

* The storage class that the Operator creates can be made non-default by editing its annotation, but this storage class cannot be deleted as long as the Operator runs.
