= Billing
Each {product-title} cluster requires a minimum annual base cluster purchase and there are two billing options available for each cluster: Standard and Customer Cloud Subscription (CCS).

Standard {product-title} clusters are deployed in to their own cloud infrastructure accounts, each owned by Red Hat. Red Hat is responsible for this account, and cloud infrastructure costs are paid directly by Red Hat. The customer only pays the Red Hat subscription costs.

In the CCS model, the customer pays the cloud infrastructure provider directly for cloud costs and the cloud infrastructure account is part of a customerâ€™s Organization, with specific access granted to Red Hat. In this model, the customer pays Red Hat for the CCS subscription and pays the cloud provider for the cloud costs. It is the customer's responsibility to pre-purchase or provide Reserved Instance (RI) compute instances to ensure lower cloud infrastructure costs.

Additional resources can be purchased for an OpenShift Dedicated Cluster, including:

* Additional nodes (can be different types and sizes through the use of machine pools)
* Middleware (JBoss EAP, JBoss Fuse, and so on) - additional pricing based on specific middleware component
* Additional storage in increments of 500 GB (standard only; 100 GB included)
* Additional 12 TiB Network I/O (standard only; 12 TB included)
* Load Balancers for Services are available in bundles of 4; enables non-HTTP/SNI traffic or non-standard ports (standard only)
