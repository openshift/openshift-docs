= Adding docker build arguments

You can set link:http://docs.docker.com/v1.7/reference/api/hub_registry_spec/#docker-registry-1-0[docker build arguments] using the `buildArgs` array. The build arguments are passed to docker when a build is started.

[TIP]
====
See link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-arg-and-from-interact[Understand how ARG and FROM interact] in the Dockerfile reference documentation.

.Procedure

To set docker build arguments, add entries to the `buildArgs` array, which is located in the `dockerStrategy` definition of the `BuildConfig` object. For example:

[source,yaml]
----
dockerStrategy:
...
  buildArgs:
    - name: "foo"
      value: "bar"
----

[NOTE]
====
Only the `name` and `value` fields are supported. Any settings on the `valueFrom` field are ignored.
