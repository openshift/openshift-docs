= Understanding how to add custom metrics autoscalers

To add a custom metrics autoscaler, create a `ScaledObject` custom resource for a deployment, stateful set, or custom resource. Create a `ScaledJob` custom resource for a job.

You can create only one scaled object or scaled job for each workload that you want to scale. Also, you cannot use a scaled object or scaled job and the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) on the same workload. 

// If you want to scale based on a custom trigger and CPU/Memory, you can create multiple triggers in the scaled object or scaled job.
