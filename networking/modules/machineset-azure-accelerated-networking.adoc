[id="machineset-azure-accelerated-networking_{context}"]
= Accelerated Networking for Microsoft Azure VMs

Accelerated Networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide Microsoft Azure VMs with a more direct path to the switch. This enhances network performance. This feature can be enabled 
ifdef::compute[during or ]
after installation.

[id="machineset-azure-accelerated-networking-limits_{context}"]
== Limitations

Consider the following limitations when deciding whether to use Accelerated Networking:

* Accelerated Networking is only supported on clusters where the Machine API is operational.

* {empty}
+
ifdef::compute[Although the minimum requirement for an Azure worker node is two vCPUs, ]
Accelerated Networking requires an Azure VM size that includes at least four vCPUs. To satisfy this requirement, you can change the value of `vmSize` in your machine set. For information about Azure VM sizes, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes[Microsoft Azure documentation].

//iiuc, this is not true for control planes since the operator will roll out changes according to the update strategy
ifdef::compute[]
* When this feature is enabled on an existing Azure cluster, only newly provisioned nodes are affected. Currently running nodes are not reconciled. To enable the feature on all nodes, you must replace each existing machine. This can be done for each machine individually, or by scaling the replicas down to zero, and then scaling back up to your desired number of replicas.
