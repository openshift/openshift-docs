[id="assigning-tolerations-to-monitoring-components_{context}"]
= Assigning tolerations to components that monitor user-defined projects

You can assign tolerations to the components that monitor user-defined projects, to enable moving them to tainted worker nodes. Scheduling is not permitted on control plane or infrastructure nodes.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `dedicated-admin` role.
* You have created the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) is installed.

.Procedure

. Edit the `ConfigMap` object:
.. Edit the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring edit configmap user-workload-monitoring-config
----

.. Specify `tolerations` for the component:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    <component>:
      tolerations:
        <toleration_specification>
----
+
Substitute `<component>` and `<toleration_specification>` accordingly.
+
For example, `oc adm taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule` adds a taint to `node1` with the key `key1` and the value `value1`. This prevents monitoring components from deploying pods on `node1` unless a toleration is configured for that taint. The following example configures the `thanosRuler` component to tolerate the example taint:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: user-workload-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-user-workload-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    thanosRuler:
      tolerations:
      - key: "key1"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "value1"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
----

. Save the file to apply the changes. The new component placement configuration is applied automatically.

[WARNING]
====
When changes are saved to a monitoring config map, the pods and other resources in the related project might be redeployed. The running monitoring processes in that project might also be restarted.
