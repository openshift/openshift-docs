|Profile|vCPU|Memory|Storage
|Minimum|4 to 8 vCPU cores|32GB of RAM| 120GB

[NOTE]
====
One vCPU is equivalent to one physical core when simultaneous multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading, is not enabled. When enabled, use the following formula to calculate the corresponding ratio:

* (threads per core × cores) × sockets = vCPUs

[IMPORTANT]
====
The server must have a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) when booting with virtual media.
