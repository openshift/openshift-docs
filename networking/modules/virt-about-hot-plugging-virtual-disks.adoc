= About hot plugging virtual disks

When you _hot plug_ a virtual disk, you attach a virtual disk to a virtual machine instance while the virtual machine is running. 

When you _hot unplug_ a virtual disk, you detach a virtual disk from a virtual machine instance while the virtual machine is running.

Only data volumes and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can be hot plugged and hot unplugged. You cannot hot plug or hot unplug container disks.

After you hot plug a virtual disk, it remains attached until you detach it, even if you restart the virtual machine.
