= Overview

Red Hat provides a published product life cycle for {product-title} in order for customers and
partners to effectively plan, deploy, and support their applications running on the platform. Red
Hat publishes this life cycle in order to provide as much transparency as possible and might make
exceptions from these policies as conflicts arise.

{product-title} is a managed instance of Red Hat OpenShift and maintains an independent release
schedule. More details about the managed offering can be found in the {product-title} service
definition. The availability of Security Advisories and Bug Fix Advisories for a specific version
are dependent upon the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform life cycle policy and subject to the
{product-title} maintenance schedule.
