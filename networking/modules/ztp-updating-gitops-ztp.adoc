= Overview of the GitOps ZTP update process

You can update GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) for a fully operational hub cluster running an earlier version of the GitOps ZTP infrastructure. The update process avoids impact on managed clusters.

[NOTE]
====
Any changes to policy settings, including adding recommended content, results in updated polices that must be rolled out to the managed clusters and reconciled.
====

At a high level, the strategy for updating the GitOps ZTP infrastructure is as follows:

. Label all existing clusters with the `ztp-done` label.

. Stop the ArgoCD applications.

. Install the new GitOps ZTP tools.

. Update required content and optional changes in the Git repository.

. Update and restart the application configuration.
