= Creating a route

External clients can access applications running on {product-title} through the routing layer and the data object behind that is a _route_. The default {product-title} router (HAProxy) uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection.

Optionally, you can define security, such as TLS, for the route.

.Prerequisites

* You must have access to an {product-title} cluster.
* You must have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have a deployed image.
* You must have `cluster-admin` or `project-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. To retrieve the created application service, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get service
