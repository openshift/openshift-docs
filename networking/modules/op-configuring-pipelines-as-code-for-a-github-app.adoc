= Configuring {pac} for a GitHub App 

[role="_abstract"]
GitHub Apps act as a point of integration with {pipelines-title} and bring the advantage of Git-based workflows to OpenShift Pipelines. Cluster administrators can configure a single GitHub App for all cluster users. For GitHub Apps to work with Pipelines as Code, ensure that the webhook of the GitHub App points to the Pipelines as Code event listener route (or ingress endpoint) that listens for GitHub events.

== Configuring a GitHub App

Cluster administrators can create a GitHub App by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ tkn pac bootstrap github-app
----

If the `tkn pac` CLI plugin is not installed, you can create the GitHub App manually.

.Procedure

To create and configure a GitHub App manually for {pac}, perform the following steps:

. Sign in to your GitHub account.

. Go to **Settings** --> **Developer settings** --> **GitHub Apps**, and click **New GitHub App**.

. Provide the following information in the GitHub App form: 

* **GitHub Application Name**: `OpenShift Pipelines`
* **Homepage URL**: OpenShift Console URL 
* **Webhook URL**: The {pac} route or ingress URL. You can find it by running the command `echo https://$(oc get route -n openshift-pipelines pipelines-as-code-controller -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')`.
+
[NOTE]
====
If {pac} is installed without using the {pipelines-title} Operator, use the `pipelines-as-code` namespace instead of `openshift-pipelines`.
====
+
* **Webhook secret**: An arbitrary secret. You can generate a secret by executing the command `openssl rand -hex 20`.

. Select the following **Repository permissions**:

* **Checks**: `Read & Write`
* **Contents**: `Read & Write`
* **Issues**: `Read & Write`
* **Metadata**: `Read-only`
* **Pull request**: `Read & Write`

. Select the following **Organization permissions**:

* **Members**: `Readonly`
* **Plan**: `Readonly`

. Select the following **User permissions**:

* **Check run**
* **Issue comment**
* **Pull request**
* **Push**

. Click **Create GitHub App**.

. On the **Details** page of the newly created GitHub App, note the **App ID** displayed at the top.

. In the **Private keys** section, click **Generate Private key** to automatically generate and download a private key for the GitHub app. Securely store the private key for future reference and usage.

. Install the created App on a repository that you want to use with Pipelines as Code.

== Configuring {pac} to access a GitHub App

To configure {pac} to access the newly created GitHub App, execute the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-pipelines create secret generic pipelines-as-code-secret \ <1>
        --from-literal github-private-key="$(cat <PATH_PRIVATE_KEY>)" \ <2>
        --from-literal github-application-id="<APP_ID>" \ <3>
        --from-literal webhook.secret="<WEBHOOK_SECRET>" <4>
----
<1> If {pac} is installed without using the {pipelines-title} Operator, use the `pipelines-as-code` namespace instead of `openshift-pipelines`.
<2> The path to the private key you downloaded while configuring the GitHub App.
<3> The **App ID** of the GitHub App.
<4> The webhook secret provided when you created the GitHub App. 


[NOTE]
====
{pac} works automatically with GitHub Enterprise by detecting the header set from GitHub Enterprise and using it for the GitHub Enterprise API authorization URL.
