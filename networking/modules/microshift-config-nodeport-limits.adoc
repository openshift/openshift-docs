= Extending the port range for NodePort services

The `serviceNodePortRange` setting allows the extension of the port range available to NodePort services. This option is useful when specific standard ports under the `30000-32767` need to be exposed. For example, your device needs to expose the `1883/tcp` MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) port on the network because some client devices cannot use a different port.

[IMPORTANT]
NodePorts can overlap with system ports, causing a malfunction of the system or {product-title}.

Considerations when configuring the NodePort service ranges:

* Do not create any NodePort service without an explicit `nodePort` selection. In this case, the port is assigned randomly by the `kube-apiserver`.

* Do not create any NodePort service for any system service port, {product-title} port, or other services you expose on your device `HostNetwork`.

* Table one specifies ports to avoid when extending the port range:

.Ports to avoid.
