= Understanding AWS account association

Before you can use the {cluster-manager-first} {hybrid-console-second} to create {product-title} (ROSA) clusters that use the AWS Security Token Service (STS), you must associate your AWS account with your Red Hat organization. You can associate your account by creating and linking the following IAM roles.

{cluster-manager} role:: Create an {cluster-manager} IAM role and link it to your Red Hat organization.
+
You can apply basic or administrative permissions to the {cluster-manager} role. The basic permissions enable cluster maintenance using the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}. The administrative permissions enable automatic deployment of the cluster-specific Operator roles and the OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider using the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second}.
ifdef::quick-install[]
+
You can use the administrative permissions with the {cluster-manager} role to deploy a cluster quickly.
endif::quick-install[]

User role:: Create a user IAM role and link it to your Red Hat user account. The Red Hat user account must exist in the Red Hat organization that is linked to your {cluster-manager} role.
+
The user role is used by Red Hat to verify your AWS identity when you use the {cluster-manager} {hybrid-console-second} to install a cluster and the required STS resources.
