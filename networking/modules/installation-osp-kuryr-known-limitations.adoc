= Known limitations of installing with Kuryr

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several known limitations.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-general-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} general limitations

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several limitations that apply to all versions and environments:

* `Service` objects with the `NodePort` type are not supported.

* Clusters that use the OVN Octavia provider driver support `Service` objects for which the `.spec.selector` property is unspecified only if the `.subsets.addresses` property of the `Endpoints` object includes the subnet of the nodes or pods. 

* If the subnet on which machines are created is not connected to a router, or if the subnet is connected, but the router has no external gateway set, Kuryr cannot create floating IPs for `Service` objects with type `LoadBalancer`.

* Configuring the `sessionAffinity=ClientIP` property on `Service` objects does not have an effect. Kuryr does not support this setting.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-version-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} version limitations

Using {product-title} with Kuryr SDN has several limitations that depend on the {rh-openstack} version.

* {rh-openstack} versions before 16 use
the default Octavia load balancer driver (Amphora). This driver requires that one
Amphora load balancer VM is deployed per {product-title} service. Creating too many
services can cause you to run out of resources.
+
Deployments of later versions of {rh-openstack} that have the OVN Octavia driver disabled also
use the Amphora driver. They are subject to the same resource concerns as earlier versions of {rh-openstack}.

* Kuryr SDN does not support automatic unidling by a service.

[discrete]
[id="openstack-upgrade-limitations_{context}"]
== {rh-openstack} upgrade limitations

As a result of the {rh-openstack} upgrade process, the Octavia API might be changed, and upgrades to the Amphora images that are used for load balancers might be required.

You can address API changes on an individual basis.

If the Amphora image is upgraded, the {rh-openstack} operator can handle existing load balancer VMs in two ways:

* Upgrade each VM by triggering a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.0/html/networking_guide/sec-octavia#update-running-amphora-instances[load balancer failover].

* Leave responsibility for upgrading the VMs to users.

If the operator takes the first option, there might be short downtimes during failovers.

If the operator takes the second option, the existing load balancers will not support upgraded Octavia
API features, like UDP listeners. In this case, users must recreate their Services to use these features.
