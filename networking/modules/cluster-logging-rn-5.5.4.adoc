== Bug fixes
* Before this update, an error in the query parser of the logging view plugin caused parts of the logs query to disappear if the query contained curly brackets `{}`. This made the queries invalid, leading to errors being returned for valid queries. With this update, the parser correctly handles these queries. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3042[LOG-3042])

* Before this update, the Operator could enter a loop of removing and recreating the collector daemonset while the Elasticsearch or Kibana deployments changed their status. With this update, a fix in the status handling of the Operator resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3049[LOG-3049])

* Before this update, no alerts were implemented to support the collector implementation of Vector. This change adds Vector alerts and deploys separate alerts, depending upon the chosen collector implementation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3127[LOG-3127])

* Before this update, the secret creation component of the Elasticsearch Operator modified internal secrets constantly. With this update, the existing secret is properly handled. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3138[LOG-3138])

* Before this update, a prior refactoring of the logging `must-gather` scripts removed the expected location for the artifacts. This update reverts that change to write artifacts to the `/must-gather` folder. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3213[LOG-3213])

* Before this update, on certain clusters, the Prometheus exporter would bind on IPv4 instead of IPv6. After this update, Fluentd detects the IP version and binds to `0.0.0.0` for IPv4 or `[::]` for IPv6. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3162[LOG-3162])
