= Sample customized install-config.yaml file for shared VPC installation
There are several configuration parameters which are required to install {product-title} on GCP using a shared VPC. The following is a sample `install-config.yaml` file which demonstrates these fields.

[IMPORTANT]

This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must modify this file with the correct values for your environment and cluster.

<1> `credentialsMode` must be set to `Passthrough` to allow the cluster to use the provided GCP service account after cluster creation. See the "Prerequisites" section for the required GCP permissions that your service account must have.
<2> The name of the subnet in the shared VPC for compute machines to use.
<3> The name of the subnet in the shared VPC for control plane machines to use.
<4> Optional. If you set `createFirewallRules` to `Disabled`, you can create and manage firewall rules manually through the use of network tags. By default, the cluster will automatically create and manage the firewall rules that are required for cluster communication. Your service account must have `roles/compute.networkAdmin` and `roles/compute.securityAdmin` privileges in the host project to perform these tasks automatically. If your service account does not have the `roles/dns.admin` privilege in the host project, it must have the `dns.networks.bindPrivateDNSZone` permission.
<5> The name of the shared VPC.
<6> The name of the host project where the shared VPC exists.
<7> Optional. The name of a public DNS zone in the host project. If you set this value, your service account must have the `roles/dns.admin` privilege in the host project. The public DNS zone domain must match the `baseDomain` parameter. If you do not set this value, the installation program will use the public DNS zone in the service project.
<8> Optional. The name of the host project which contains the public DNS zone. This value is required if you specify a public DNS zone that exists in another project.
<9> The name of the GCP project where you want to install the cluster.
<10> Optional. If you want to manually create and manage your GCP firewall rules, you can set `platform.gcp.createFirewallRules` to `Disabled` and then specify one or more network tags. You can set tags on the compute machines, the control plane machines, or all machines.
<11> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the machines in your cluster.
