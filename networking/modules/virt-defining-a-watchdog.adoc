[id="virt-defining-a-watchdog"]
= Defining a watchdog device

Define how the watchdog proceeds when the operating system (OS) no longer responds.

.Available actions
[horizontal]
`poweroff`:: The virtual machine (VM) powers down immediately. If `spec.running` is set to `true`, or `spec.runStrategy` is not set to `manual`, then the VM reboots.
`reset`:: The VM reboots in place and the guest OS cannot react. Because the length of time required for the guest OS to reboot can cause liveness probes to timeout, use of this option is discouraged. This timeout can extend the time it takes the VM to reboot if cluster-level protections notice the liveness probe failed and forcibly reschedule it.
`shutdown`:: The VM gracefully powers down by stopping all services.


.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with the following contents:

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: vm2-rhel84-watchdog
  name: <vm-name>
spec:
  running: false
  template:
    metadata:
     labels:
        kubevirt.io/vm: vm2-rhel84-watchdog
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          watchdog:
            name: <watchdog>
            i6300esb:
              action: "poweroff" <1>
...
----
<1> Specify the `watchdog` action (`poweroff`, `reset`, or `shutdown`).

+
The example above configures the `i6300esb` watchdog device on a RHEL8 VM with the poweroff action and exposes the device as `/dev/watchdog`.
+
This device can now be used by the watchdog binary.

. Apply the YAML file to your cluster by running the following command:

+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
----

.Verification

--
[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure is provided for testing watchdog functionality only and must not be run on production machines.
====
--

. Run the following command to verify that the VM is connected to the watchdog device:

+
[source,terminal]
----
$ lspci | grep watchdog -i
----

. Run one of the following commands to confirm the watchdog is active:


* Trigger a kernel panic:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
----

* Terminate the watchdog service:
+
[source,terminal]
----
# pkill -9 watchdog
----
