= Understanding and accessing the web console

The web console runs as a pod on the master. The static assets required to run the web console are served by the pod. After {product-title} is successfully installed using `openshift-install create cluster`, find the URL for the web console and login credentials for your installed cluster in the CLI output of the installation program. For example:

[source,terminal]
.Example output
----
INFO Install complete!
INFO Run 'export KUBECONFIG=<your working directory>/auth/kubeconfig' to manage the cluster with 'oc', the OpenShift CLI.
INFO The cluster is ready when 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p <provided>' succeeds (wait a few minutes).
INFO Access the OpenShift web-console here: https://console-openshift-console.apps.demo1.openshift4-beta-abcorp.com
INFO Login to the console with user: kubeadmin, password: <provided>
----

Use those details to log in and access the web console.

For existing clusters that you did not install, you can use `oc whoami --show-console` to see the web console URL.
