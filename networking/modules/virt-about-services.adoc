= About services

A Kubernetes _service_ is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service. Services allow your applications to receive traffic. Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a `spec.type` in the `Service` object:

ClusterIP:: Exposes the service on an internal IP address within the cluster. `ClusterIP` is the default service `type`.

NodePort:: Exposes the service on the same port of each selected node in the cluster. `NodePort` makes a service accessible from outside the cluster.

LoadBalancer:: Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP address to the service.

[NOTE]
====
For on-premise clusters, you can configure a load balancing service by using the MetalLB Operator in layer 2 mode. The BGP mode is not supported. The MetalLB Operator is installed in the `metallb-system` namespace.
