= Collecting data about virtual machines

Collecting data about malfunctioning virtual machines (VMs) minimizes the time required to analyze and determine the root cause.

.Prerequisites

* Windows VMs:
** Record the Windows patch update details for Red Hat Support.
** Install the latest version of the VirtIO drivers. The VirtIO drivers include the QEMU guest agent.
** If Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is enabled, try to connect to the VMs with RDP to determine whether there is a problem with the connection software.

.Procedure

. Collect detailed `must-gather` data about the malfunctioning VMs.
. Collect screenshots of VMs that have crashed before you restart them.
. Record factors that the malfunctioning VMs have in common. For example, the VMs have the same host or network.
// . Collect memory dumps from VMs _before_ remediation attempts.
// Uncomment this line for CNV-20256.
