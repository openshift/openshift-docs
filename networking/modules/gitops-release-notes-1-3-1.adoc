== Fixed issues

* If you upgrade to v1.3.0, the Operator does not return an ordered slice of environment variables. As a result, the reconciler fails causing the frequent recreation of Argo CD pods in {product-title} clusters running behind a proxy. This update fixes the issue so that Argo CD pods are not recreated. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-1489[GITOPS-1489]
