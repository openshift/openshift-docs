Because of an issue introduced in version 2.6, TLS connections could not be established with {product-title} {SMProductShortName}. 
This update resolves the issue by changing the service port names to match conventions used by {product-title} {SMProductShortName} and Istio. 

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OBSDA-208[OBSDA-208]
 Before this update, the default 200m CPU and 256Mi memory resource limits could cause {OTELShortName} to restart continuously on large clusters.
 This update resolves the issue by removing these resource limits.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OBSDA-222[OBSDA-222]
Before this update, spans could be dropped in the {product-title} {JaegerShortName}. 
To help prevent this issue from occurring, this release updates version dependencies.

Jaeger is logging a repetitive warning message in the Jaeger logs similar to the following:
+
[source,terminal]
----
{"level":"warn","ts":1642438880.918793,"caller":"channelz/logging.go:62","msg":"[core]grpc: Server.Serve failed to create ServerTransport: connection error: desc = \"transport: http2Server.HandleStreams received bogus greeting from client: \\\"\\\\x16\\\\x03\\\\x01\\\\x02\\\\x00\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x01\\\\xfc\\\\x03\\\\x03vw\\\\x1a\\\\xc9T\\\\xe7\\\\xdaCj\\\\xb7\\\\x8dK\\\\xa6\\\"\"","system":"grpc","grpc_log":true}

This issue was resolved by exposing only the HTTP(S) port of the query service, and not the gRPC port.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-2009[TRACING-2009] The Jaeger Operator has been updated to include support for the Strimzi Kafka Operator 0.23.0.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1907[TRACING-1907] The Jaeger agent sidecar injection was failing due to missing config maps in the application namespace. The config maps were getting automatically deleted due to an incorrect `OwnerReference` field setting and as a result, the application pods were not moving past the "ContainerCreating" stage. The incorrect settings have been removed.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1725[TRACING-1725] Follow-up to TRACING-1631. Additional fix to ensure that Elasticsearch certificates are properly reconciled when there are multiple Jaeger production instances, using same name but within different namespaces. See also link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918920[BZ-1918920].

* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TRACING-1631[TRACING-1631] Multiple Jaeger production instances, using same name but within different namespaces, causing Elasticsearch certificate issue. When multiple service meshes were installed, all of the Jaeger Elasticsearch instances had the same Elasticsearch secret instead of individual secrets, which prevented the OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator from communicating with all of the Elasticsearch clusters.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1300[TRACING-1300] Failed connection between Agent and Collector when using Istio sidecar. An update of the Jaeger Operator enabled TLS communication by default between a Jaeger sidecar agent and the Jaeger Collector.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1208[TRACING-1208] Authentication "500 Internal Error" when accessing Jaeger UI. When trying to authenticate to the UI using OAuth, I get a 500 error because oauth-proxy sidecar doesn't trust the custom CA bundle defined at installation time with the `additionalTrustBundle`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-1166[TRACING-1166] It is not currently possible to use the Jaeger streaming strategy within a disconnected environment. When a Kafka cluster is being provisioned, it results in a error: `Failed to pull image registry.redhat.io/amq7/amq-streams-kafka-24-rhel7@sha256:f9ceca004f1b7dccb3b82d9a8027961f9fe4104e0ed69752c0bdd8078b4a1076`.

* link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/TRACING-809[TRACING-809] Jaeger Ingester is incompatible with Kafka 2.3. When there are two or more instances of the Jaeger Ingester and enough traffic it will continuously generate rebalancing messages in the logs. This is due to a regression in Kafka 2.3 that was fixed in Kafka 2.3.1. For more information, see https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues/1819[Jaegertracing-1819].

* link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1918920[BZ-1918920]/link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1619[LOG-1619] The Elasticsearch pods does not get restarted automatically after an update.
+
Workaround: Restart the pods manually.
