= Setting environment variables from all values defined in a secret

You can set an environment variable from all values defined in a secret. Values previously stored in a secret can then be accessed as environment variables by the function at runtime. This can be useful for simultaneously getting access to a collection of values stored in a secret, for example, a set of data pertaining to a user.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.
* You have created a function.

.Procedure

. Open the `func.yaml` file for your function.

. For every secret for which you want to import all key-value pairs as environment variables, add the following YAML to the `envs` section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
envs:
- value: '{{ secret:mysecret }}' <1>
----
<1> Substitute `mysecret` with the name of the target secret.
+
For example, to access all user data that is stored in `userdetailssecret`, use the following YAML:
+
[source,yaml]
----
name: test
namespace: ""
runtime: go
...
envs:
- value: '{{ configMap:userdetailssecret }}'
----

. Save the configuration.
