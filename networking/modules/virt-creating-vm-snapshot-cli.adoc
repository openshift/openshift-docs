= Creating a virtual machine snapshot in the CLI

You can create a virtual machine (VM) snapshot for an offline or online VM by creating a `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object. Kubevirt will coordinate with the QEMU guest agent to create a snapshot of the online VM.

[NOTE]
====
To create snapshots of an online (Running state) VM with the highest integrity, install the QEMU guest agent.

The QEMU guest agent takes a consistent snapshot by attempting to quiesce the VMâ€™s file system as much as possible, depending on the system workload. This ensures that in-flight I/O is written to the disk before the snapshot is taken. If the guest agent is not present, quiescing is not possible and a best-effort snapshot is taken. The conditions under which the snapshot was taken are reflected in the snapshot indications that are displayed in the web console or CLI.
====

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that the persistent volume claims (PVCs) are in a storage class that supports Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Optional: Power down the VM for which you want to create a snapshot.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file to define a `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object that specifies the name of the new `VirtualMachineSnapshot` and the name of the source VM.
+
For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: snapshot.kubevirt.io/v1alpha1
kind: VirtualMachineSnapshot
metadata:
  name: my-vmsnapshot <1>
spec:
  source:
    apiGroup: kubevirt.io
    kind: VirtualMachine
    name: my-vm <2>
----
<1> The name of the new `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object.
<2> The name of the source VM.

. Create the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` resource. The snapshot controller creates a `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` object, binds it to the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` and updates the `status` and `readyToUse` fields
of the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <my-vmsnapshot>.yaml
----

. Optional: If you are taking an online snapshot, you can use the `wait` command and monitor the status of the snapshot:
.. Enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl wait my-vm my-vmsnapshot --for condition=Ready
----
.. Verify the status of the snapshot:
* `InProgress` - The online snapshot operation is still in progress.
* `Succeeded` - The online snapshot operation completed successfully.
* `Failed` - The online snapshot operaton failed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Online snapshots have a default time deadline of five minutes (`5m`). If the snapshot does not complete successfully in five minutes, the status is set to `failed`. Afterwards, the file system will be thawed and the VM unfrozen but the status remains `failed` until you delete the failed snapshot image.

To change the default time deadline, add the `FailureDeadline` attribute to the VM snapshot spec with the time designated in minutes (`m`) or in seconds (`s`) that you want to specify before the snapshot operation times out.

To set no deadline, you can specify `0`, though this is generally not recommended, as it can result in an unresponsive VM.

If you do not specify a unit of time such as `m` or `s`, the default is seconds (`s`).
====

.Verification

. Verify that the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object is created and bound with `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent`. The `readyToUse` flag must be set to `true`.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe vmsnapshot <my-vmsnapshot>

<1> The `status` field of the `Progressing` condition specifies if the snapshot is still being created.
<2> The `status` field of the `Ready` condition specifies if the snapshot creation process is complete.
<3> Specifies if the snapshot is ready to be used.
<4> Specifies that the snapshot is bound to a `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` object created by the snapshot controller.

. Check the `spec:volumeBackups` property of the `VirtualMachineSnapshotContent` resource to verify that the expected PVCs are included in the snapshot.
