= Granting view permissions

{product-title} automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project. The default service account takes responsibility for running the pods. {product-title} uses and injects this service account into every pod that launches.

The following procedure creates a `RoleBinding` object for the default `ServiceAccount` object. The service account communicates with the {product-title} API to learn about pods, services, and resources within the project.

.Prerequisites

* You have a deployed image.
