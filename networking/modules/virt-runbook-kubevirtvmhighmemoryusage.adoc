[id="meaning-kubevirtvmhighmemoryusage_{context}"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when a container hosting a virtual machine (VM) has less
than 20 MB free memory.

[discrete]
[id="impact-kubevirtvmhighmemoryusage_{context}"]
== Impact

The virtual machine running inside the container is terminated by the runtime
if the container's memory limit is exceeded.

[id="diagnosis-kubevirtvmhighmemoryusage_{context}"]
== Diagnosis

. Obtain the `virt-launcher` pod details:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod <virt-launcher> -o yaml
----

. Identify `compute` container processes with high memory usage in the
`virt-launcher` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc exec -it <virt-launcher> -c compute -- top
----

[discrete]
[id="mitigation-kubevirtvmhighmemoryusage_{context}"]
== Mitigation

* Increase the memory limit in the `VirtualMachine` specification as in
the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
