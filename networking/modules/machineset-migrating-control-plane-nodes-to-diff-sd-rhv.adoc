[id="machineset-migrating-control-plane-nodes-to-diff-sd-rhv_{context}"]
= Migrating control plane nodes to a different storage domain on {rh-virtualization}

{product-title} does not manage control plane nodes, so they are easier to migrate than compute nodes. You can migrate them like any other virtual machine on {rh-virtualization-first}.

Perform this procedure for each node separately.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {rh-virtualization-engine-name}.
* You have identified the control plane nodes. They are labeled *master* in the {rh-virtualization-engine-name}.

.Procedure

. Select the virtual machine labeled *master*.

. Shut down the virtual machine.

. Click the *Disks* tab.

. Click the virtual machine's disk.

. Click *More Actions*{kebab} and select *Move*.

. Select the target storage domain and wait for the migration process to complete.

. Start the virtual machine.

. Verify that the {product-title} cluster is stable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
+
The output should display the node with the status `Ready`.

. Repeat this procedure for each control plane node.
