= Updating mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift from a local host

This procedure explains how to update the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ from a local host using the `upgrade` command. Updating to the latest version ensures bug fixes and security vulnerability fixes.

When updating, there is intermittent downtime of your mirror registry, as it is restarted during the update process.

[NOTE]
====
Users who upgrade the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with the `./mirror-registry upgrade -v` flag must include the same credentials used when creating their mirror registry. For example, if you installed the _mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift_ with `--quayHostname <host_example_com>` and `--quayRoot <example_directory_name>`, you must include that string to properly upgrade the mirror registry.
