= Creating a certificate to encrypt incoming external traffic

By default, the {SMProductShortName} mTLS feature only secures traffic inside of the {SMProductShortName} itself, between the ingress gateway and individual pods that have sidecars. To encrypt traffic as it flows into the {product-title} cluster, you must generate a certificate before you enable the {ServerlessProductName} and {SMProductShortName} integration.

.Prerequisites

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated,openshift-rosa[]
* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster or dedicated administrator access.
endif::[]

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Create a root certificate and private key that signs the certificates for your Knative services:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -subj '/O=Example Inc./CN=example.com' \
    -keyout root.key \
    -out root.crt
----
. Create a wildcard certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -subj "/CN=*.apps.openshift.example.com/O=Example Inc." \
    -keyout wildcard.key \
    -out wildcard.csr
----
. Sign the wildcard certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -set_serial 0 \
    -CA root.crt \
    -CAkey root.key \
    -in wildcard.csr \
    -out wildcard.crt
----
. Create a secret by using the wildcard certificate:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -n istio-system secret tls wildcard-certs \
    --key=wildcard.key \
    --cert=wildcard.crt
----
+
This certificate is picked up by the gateways created when you integrate {ServerlessProductName} with {SMProductShortName}, so that the ingress gateway serves traffic with this certificate.
