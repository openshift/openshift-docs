= Deleting AWS resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To clean up resources after uninstalling an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with STS, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

= Deleting GCP resources with the Cloud Credential Operator utility

To clean up resources after uninstalling an {product-title} cluster with the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in manual mode with GCP Workload Identity, you can use the CCO utility (`ccoctl`) to remove the GCP resources that `ccoctl` created during installation.

.Prerequisites

* Extract and prepare the `ccoctl` binary.
ifdef::aws-sts[]
* Install an {product-title} cluster with the CCO in manual mode with STS.

.Procedure

ifdef::aws-sts[]
* Delete the AWS resources that `ccoctl` created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl aws delete \
  --name=<name> \ <1>
  --region=<aws_region> <2>
----
+
<1> `<name>` matches the name that was originally used to create and tag the cloud resources.
<2> `<aws_region>` is the AWS region in which to delete cloud resources.
+
.Example output:
+
[source,terminal]

. Obtain the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ RELEASE_IMAGE=$(./openshift-install version | awk '/release image/ {print $3}')
----

. Extract the list of `CredentialsRequest` custom resources (CRs) from the {product-title} release image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm release extract --credentials-requests \
  --cloud=gcp \
  --to=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests \ <1>
  $RELEASE_IMAGE
----
+
<1> `credrequests` is the directory where the list of `CredentialsRequest` objects is stored. This command creates the directory if it does not exist.

. Delete the GCP resources that `ccoctl` created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ccoctl gcp delete \
  --name=<name> \ <1>
  --project=<gcp_project_id> \ <2>
  --credentials-requests-dir=<path_to_directory_with_list_of_credentials_requests>/credrequests
----
+
<1> `<name>` matches the name that was originally used to create and tag the cloud resources.
<2> `<gcp_project_id>` is the GCP project ID in which to delete cloud resources.
