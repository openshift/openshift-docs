= About the hostpath provisioner

When you install the {VirtProductName} Operator, the Hostpath Provisioner (HPP) Operator is automatically installed. The HPP is a local storage provisioner designed for {VirtProductName} that is created by the Hostpath Provisioner Operator. To use the HPP, you must create an HPP custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {VirtProductName} 4.10, the HPP Operator configures the Kubernetes CSI driver. The Operator also recognizes the existing (legacy) format of the HPP CR.

The legacy HPP and the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver are supported in parallel for a number of releases. However, at some point, the legacy HPP will no longer be supported. If you use the HPP, plan to create a storage class for the CSI driver as part of your migration strategy.
====

If you upgrade to {VirtProductName} version 4.10 on an existing cluster, the HPP Operator is upgraded and the system performs the following actions:

* The CSI driver is installed.
* The CSI driver is configured with the contents of your legacy HPP CR.

If you install {VirtProductName} version 4.10 on a new cluster, you must perform the following actions:

* Create an HPP CR with a basic storage pool.
* Create a storage class for the CSI driver.

Optional: You can create a storage pool with a PVC template for multiple HPP volumes.
