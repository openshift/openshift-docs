= Windows Machine Config Operator does not install

If you have completed the process of installing the Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO), but the Operator is stuck in the `InstallWaiting` phase, your issue is likely caused by a networking issue.

The WMCO requires your {product-title} cluster to be configured with hybrid networking using OVN-Kubernetes; the WMCO cannot complete the installation process without hybrid networking available. This is necessary to manage nodes on multiple operating systems (OS) and OS variants. This must be completed during the installation of your cluster.
