== Meaning

This alert fires when an operand of the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO)
is changed by someone or something other than HCO.

HCO configures {VirtProductName} and its supporting operators in an
opinionated way and overwrites its operands when there is an unexpected change
to them. Users must not modify the operands directly. The `HyperConverged`
custom resource is the source of truth for the configuration.

[id="impact-kubevirthyperconvergedclusteroperatorcrmodification_{context}"]
== Impact

Changing the operands manually causes the cluster configuration to fluctuate
and might lead to instability.

== Diagnosis

* Check the `component_name` value in the alert details to determine the operand
kind (`kubevirt`) and the operand name (`kubevirt-kubevirt-hyperconverged`)
that are being changed:

[id="mitigation-kubevirthyperconvergedclusteroperatorcrmodification_{context}"]
== Mitigation

Do not change the HCO operands directly. Use `HyperConverged` objects to configure
the cluster.

The alert resolves itself after 10 minutes if the operands are not changed manually.
