= Creating the KataConfig custom resource in the web console

You must create one `KataConfig` custom resource (CR) to enable installing `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on your cluster nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Creating the `KataConfig` CR automatically reboots the worker nodes. The reboot can take from 10 to more than 60 minutes. Factors that impede reboot time are as follows:

* A larger {product-title} deployment with a greater number of worker nodes.
* Activation of the BIOS and Diagnostics utility.
* Deployment on a hard drive rather than an SSD.
* Deployment on physical nodes such as bare metal, rather than on virtual nodes.
* A slow CPU and network.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.

[NOTE]
====
Kata is installed on all worker nodes by default. If you want to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` only on specific nodes, you can add labels to those nodes, then define the label in the `KataConfig` CR when you create it.
====

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, navigate to *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators*.

. Select the {sandboxed-containers-operator} from the list of operators.

. In the *KataConfig* tab, click *Create KataConfig*.

. In the *Create KataConfig* page, enter the following details:
+
* *Name*: Enter a name for the `KataConfig` resource. By default, the name is defined as `example-kataconfig`.

* *Labels* (Optional): Enter any relevant, identifying attributes to the `KataConfig` resource. Each label represents a key-value pair.

* *`checkNodeEligibility`* (Optional): Select this checkbox to use the Node Feature Discovery Operator (NFD) to detect node eligibility to run `kata` as a `RuntimeClass`. For more information, see "Checking whether cluster nodes are eligible to run {sandboxed-containers-first}".

* *`kataConfigPoolSelector`*: By default, `kata` is installed as a `RuntimeClass` on all nodes. If you want to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` only on selected nodes, you must add a *matchExpression*:
+
.. Expand the *`kataConfigPoolSelector`* area.

.. In the *`kataConfigPoolSelector`*, expand *matchExpressions*. This is a list of label selector requirements.

.. Click *Add matchExpressions*.

.. In the *key* field, add the label key the selector applies to.

.. In the *operator* field, add the key's relationship to the label values. Valid operators are `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, and `DoesNotExist`.

.. Expand  the *values* area, and then click *Add value*.

.. In the *Value* field, enter `true` or `false` for *key* label value.

* *`logLevel`*: Define the level of log data retrieved for nodes running `kata` as a `RuntimeClass`. For more information, see "Collecting {sandboxed-containers-first} data".

. Click *Create*.

The new `KataConfig` CR is created and begins to install `kata` as a `RuntimeClass` on the worker nodes. Wait for the `kata` installation to complete and the worker nodes to reboot before continuing to the next step.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata only as a secondary, optional runtime on the cluster and not as the primary runtime.
====

.Verification

. In the *KataConfig* tab, select the new `KataConfig` CR.

. In the *KataConfig* page, select the *YAML* tab.

. Monitor the *installationStatus* field in the status.
+
A message appears each time there is an update. Click *Reload* to view the updated `KataConfig` CR.
+
Once the value of *Completed nodes* equals the number of worker or labeled nodes, the installation is complete. The status also contains a list of nodes where the installation is completed.
