_Operator Lifecycle Manager_ (OLM) helps users install, update, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes native applications (Operators) and their associated services running across their {product-title} clusters. It is part of the link:https://operatorframework.io/[Operator Framework], an open source toolkit designed to manage Operators in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

OLM runs by default in {product-title} {product-version}, which aids cluster administrators in installing, upgrading, and granting access to Operators running on their cluster. The {product-title} web console provides management screens for cluster administrators to install Operators, as well as grant specific projects access to use the catalog of Operators available on the cluster.

For developers, a self-service experience allows provisioning and configuring instances of databases, monitoring, and big data services without having to be subject matter experts, because the Operator has that knowledge baked into it.
