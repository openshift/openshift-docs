This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:2217[RHSA-2022:2217 OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.3.7]

[id="openshift-logging-5-3-7-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Linux audit log time parsing relied on an ordinal position of key/value pair. This update changes the parsing to utilize a regex to find the time entry. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2322[LOG-2322])

* * Before this update some log forwarder outputs could re-order logs with the same time-stamp. With this update, a sequence number has been added to the log record to order entries that have matching timestamps. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2334[LOG-2334])

* Before this update, clusters with a large number of namespaces caused Elasticsearch to stop serving requests because the list of namespaces reached the maximum header size limit. With this update, headers only include a list of namespace names, resolving the issue. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2450[LOG-2450])

* Before this update, `system:serviceaccount:openshift-monitoring:prometheus-k8s` had cluster level privileges as a `clusterrole` and `clusterrolebinding`. This update restricts the `serviceaccount` to the `openshift-logging` namespace with a role and rolebinding. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2481[LOG-2481)])

== OpenShift Logging 5.3.6
This release includes link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2022:1377[RHBA-2022:1377 OpenShift Logging Bug Fix Release 5.3.6]

[id="openshift-logging-5-3-6-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, defining a toleration with no key and the existing Operator caused the Operator to be unable to complete an upgrade. With this update, this toleration no longer blocks the upgrade from completing. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2126[LOG-2126])

* Before this change, it was possible for the collector to generate a warning where the chunk byte limit was exceeding an emitted event. With this change, you can tune the readline limit to resolve the issue as advised by the upstream documentation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2380[LOG-2380])

=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, if you removed OpenShift Logging from {product-title}, the web console continued displaying a link to the *Logging* page. With this update, removing or uninstalling OpenShift Logging also removes that link. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2182[LOG-2182])

[id="openshift-logging-5-3-4-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
*  Before this update, changes to the metrics dashboards had not yet been deployed because the `cluster-logging-operator` did not correctly compare existing and desired config maps that contained the dashboard.  This update fixes the logic by adding a unique hash value to the object labels. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2066[LOG-2066])

* Before this update, Elasticsearch pods failed to start after updating with FIPS enabled. With this update, Elasticsearch pods start successfully. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1974[LOG-1974])

* Before this update, elasticsearch generated the error "Unable to create PersistentVolumeClaim due to forbidden: exceeded quota: infra-storage-quota." if the PVC already existed. With this update, elasticsearch checks for existing PVCs, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2127[LOG-2127])

[id="openshift-logging-5-3-2-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Elasticsearch rejected logs from the Event Router due to a parsing error. This update changes the data model to resolve the parsing error. However, as a result, previous indices might cause warnings or errors within Kibana. The `kubernetes.event.metadata.resourceVersion` field causes errors until existing indices are removed or reindexed. If this field is not used in Kibana, you can ignore the error messages. If you have a retention policy that deletes old indices, the policy eventually removes the old indices and stops the error messages. Otherwise, manually reindex to stop the error messages. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2087[LOG-2087])

* Before this update, the OpenShift Logging Dashboard displayed the wrong pod namespace in the table that displays top producing and collected containers over the last 24 hours. With this update, the OpenShift Logging Dashboard displays the correct pod namespace. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2051[LOG-2051])

* Before this update, if `outputDefaults.elasticsearch.structuredTypeKey` in the `ClusterLogForwarder` custom resource (CR) instance did not have a structured key, the CR replaced the output secret with the default secret used to communicate to the default log store. With this update, the defined output secret is correctly used. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2046[LOG-2046])

* Before this update, the Fluentd container image included builder tools that were unnecessary at run time. This update removes those tools from the image. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1998[LOG-1998])

* Before this update, the Logging dashboard displayed an empty CPU graph because of a reference to an invalid metric. With this update, the Logging dashboard displays CPU graphs correctly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1925[LOG-1925])

* Before this update, the Elasticsearch Prometheus exporter plugin compiled index-level metrics using a high-cost query that impacted the Elasticsearch node performance. This update implements a lower-cost query that improves performance. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-1897[LOG-1897])
