= About vTPM devices

A virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) device functions like a
physical Trusted Platform Module (TPM) hardware chip.

You can use a vTPM device with any operating system, but Windows 11 requires
the presence of a TPM chip to install or boot. A vTPM device allows VMs created
from a Windows 11 image to function without a physical TPM chip.

If you do not enable vTPM, then the VM does not recognize a TPM device, even if
the node has one.

vTPM devices also protect virtual machines by temporarily storing secrets
without physical hardware. However, using vTPM for persistent secret storage is
not currently supported. vTPM discards stored secrets after a VM shuts down.
