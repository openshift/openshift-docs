= Customizing labels and annotations for {product-title} routes

{product-title} routes support the use of custom labels and annotations, which you can configure by modifying the `metadata` spec of a Knative service. Custom labels and annotations are propagated from the service to the Knative route, then to the Knative ingress, and finally to the {product-title} route.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a Knative service that contains the label or annotation that you want to propagate to the {product-title} route:
** To create a service by using YAML:
+
.Example service created by using YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <service_name>
  labels:
    <label_name>: <label_value>
  annotations:
    <annotation_name>: <annotation_value>
...
----
** To create a service by using the Knative (`kn`) CLI, enter:
+
.Example service created by using a `kn` command
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn service create <service_name> \
  --image=<image> \
  --annotation <annotation_name>=<annotation_value> \
  --label <label_value>=<label_value>
----

. Verify that the {product-title} route has been created with the annotation or label that you added by inspecting the output from the following command:
+
.Example command for verification
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get routes.route.openshift.io \
     -l serving.knative.openshift.io/ingressName=<service_name> \ <1>
     -l serving.knative.openshift.io/ingressNamespace=<service_namespace> \ <2>
     -n knative-serving-ingress -o yaml \
         | grep -e "<label_name>: \"<label_value>\""  -e "<annotation_name>: <annotation_value>" <3>
----
<1> Use the name of your service.
<2> Use the namespace where your service was created.
<3> Use your values for the label and annotation names and values.
