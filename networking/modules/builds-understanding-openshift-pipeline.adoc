= Understanding {product-title} pipelines

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Pipeline build strategy is deprecated in {product-title} 4. Equivalent and improved functionality is present in the {product-title} Pipelines based on Tekton.

Jenkins images on {product-title} are fully supported and users should follow Jenkins user documentation for defining their `jenkinsfile` in a job or store it in a Source Control Management system.
====

Pipelines give you control over building, deploying, and promoting your applications on {product-title}. Using a combination of the Jenkins Pipeline build strategy, `jenkinsfiles`, and the {product-title} Domain Specific Language (DSL) provided by the Jenkins Client Plugin, you can create advanced build, test, deploy, and promote pipelines for any scenario.

*{product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Sync Plugin keeps the build configuration and build objects in sync with Jenkins jobs and builds, and provides the following:

 * Dynamic job and run creation in Jenkins.
 * Dynamic creation of agent pod templates from image streams, image stream tags, or config maps.
 * Injection of environment variables.
 * Pipeline visualization in the {product-title} web console.
 * Integration with the Jenkins Git plugin, which passes commit information from {product-title} builds to the Jenkins Git plugin.
 * Synchronization of secrets into Jenkins credential entries.

*{product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin*

The {product-title} Jenkins Client Plugin is a Jenkins plugin which aims to provide a readable, concise, comprehensive, and fluent Jenkins Pipeline syntax for rich interactions with an {product-title} API Server. The plugin uses the {product-title} command line tool, `oc`, which must be available on the nodes executing the script.

The Jenkins Client Plugin must be installed on your Jenkins master so the {product-title} DSL will be available to use within the `jenkinsfile` for your application. This plugin is installed and enabled by default when using the {product-title} Jenkins image.

For {product-title} Pipelines within your project, you will must use the Jenkins Pipeline Build Strategy. This strategy defaults to using a `jenkinsfile` at the root of your source repository, but also provides the following configuration options:

* An inline `jenkinsfile` field within your build configuration.
* A `jenkinsfilePath` field within your build configuration that references the location of the `jenkinsfile` to use relative to the source `contextDir`.

[NOTE]
====
The optional `jenkinsfilePath` field specifies the name of the file to use, relative to the source `contextDir`. If `contextDir` is omitted, it defaults to the root of the repository. If `jenkinsfilePath` is omitted, it defaults to `jenkinsfile`.
