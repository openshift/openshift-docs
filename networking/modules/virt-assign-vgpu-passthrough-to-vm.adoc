= Assigning vGPU passthrough devices to a virtual machine

Use the {product-title} web console to assign vGPU passthrough devices to your virtual machine.

.Prerequisites

* The virtual machine must be stopped.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, click *Virtualization -> VirtualMachines* from the side menu.
. Select the virtual machine to which you want to assign the device.
. On the *Details* tab, click *GPU devices*.
+
If you add a vGPU device as a host device, you cannot access the device with the VNC console.

. Click *Add GPU device*, enter the *Name* and select the device from the *Device name* list.
. Click *Save*.
. Click the *YAML* tab to verify that the new devices have been added to your cluster configuration in the `hostDevices` section.

[NOTE]
====
You can add hardware devices to virtual machines created from customized templates or a YAML file. You cannot add devices to pre-supplied boot source templates for specific operating systems, such as Windows 10 or RHEL 7.

To display resources that are connected to your cluster, click *Compute* -> *Hardware Devices* from the side menu.
