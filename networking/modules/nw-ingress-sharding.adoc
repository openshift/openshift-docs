= Ingress Controller sharding

As the primary mechanism for traffic to enter the cluster, the demands on the Ingress Controller, or router, can be significant. As a cluster administrator, you can shard the routes to:

* Balance Ingress Controllers, or routers, with several routes to speed up responses to changes.
* Allocate certain routes to have different reliability guarantees than other routes.
* Allow certain Ingress Controllers to have different policies defined.
* Allow only specific routes to use additional features.
* Expose different routes on different addresses so that internal and external users can see different routes, for example.

Ingress Controller can use either route labels or namespace labels as a sharding method.
