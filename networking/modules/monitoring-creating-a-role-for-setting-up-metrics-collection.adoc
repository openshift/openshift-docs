= Creating a role for setting up metrics collection

This procedure shows how to create a role that allows a user to set up metrics collection for a service as described in "Setting up metrics collection".

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the new role. In this example, it is called `custom-metrics-role.yaml`.

. Fill the file with the configuration for the `monitor-crd-edit` role:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: monitor-crd-edit
rules:
- apiGroups: ["monitoring.coreos.com"]
  resources: ["prometheusrules", "servicemonitors", "podmonitors"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
----
+
This role enables a user to set up metrics collection for services.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc apply -f custom-metrics-role.yaml
----
+
Now the role is created.
