= Automatically updating the control plane configuration

You can use the `RollingUpdate` update strategy to automatically propagate changes to your control plane configuration.

For clusters that use the default `RollingUpdate` update strategy, the Operator creates a replacement control plane machine with the configuration that is specified in the CR. When the replacement control plane machine is ready, the Operator deletes the control plane machine that is marked for replacement. The replacement machine then joins the control plane.

If multiple control plane machines are marked for replacement, the Operator repeats this replacement process one machine at a time until each machine is replaced.
