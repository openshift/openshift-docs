= Upgrading the performance profile to use device interrupt processing

When you upgrade the Node Tuning Operator performance profile custom resource definition (CRD) from v1 or v1alpha1 to v2, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `true` on existing profiles.

[NOTE]
====
`globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` toggles whether IRQ load balancing will be disabled for the Isolated CPU set. When the option is set to `true` it disables IRQ load balancing for the Isolated CPU set. Setting the option to `false` allows the IRQs to be balanced across all CPUs.

== Supported API Versions

The Node Tuning Operator supports `v2`, `v1`, and `v1alpha1` for the performance profile `apiVersion` field. The v1 and v1alpha1 APIs are identical. The v2 API includes an optional boolean field `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` with a default value of `false`.

=== Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 to v1

When upgrading Node Tuning Operator API version from v1alpha1 to v1, the v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted on-the-fly using a "None" Conversion strategy and served to the Node Tuning Operator with API version v1.

=== Upgrading Node Tuning Operator API from v1alpha1 or v1 to v2

When upgrading from an older Node Tuning Operator API version, the existing v1 and v1alpha1 performance profiles are converted using a conversion webhook that injects the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field with a value of `true`.
