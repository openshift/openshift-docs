= About Keystone authentication

link:http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/[Keystone] is an OpenStack project that provides identity, token, catalog, and policy services.

You can configure the integration with Keystone so that the new {product-title} users are based on either the Keystone user names or unique Keystone IDs. With both methods, users log in by entering their Keystone user name and password. Basing the {product-title} users on the Keystone ID is more secure because if you delete a Keystone user and create a new Keystone user with that user name, the new user might have access to the old user's resources.
