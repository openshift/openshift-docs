= Configuring persistent disk types by using compute machine sets

You can configure the type of persistent disk that a compute machine set deploys machines on by editing the compute machine set YAML file. 

For more information about persistent disk types, compatibility, regional availability, and limitations, see the GCP Compute Engine documentation about link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks#pdspecs[persistent disks].

.Procedure

. In a text editor, open the YAML file for an existing compute machine set or create a new one.

. Edit the following line under the `providerSpec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
providerSpec:
  value:
    disks:
      type: <pd-disk-type> <1>
----
<1> Specify the disk persistent type. Valid values are `pd-ssd`, `pd-standard`, and `pd-balanced`. The default value is `pd-standard`.

.Verification

* On the Google Cloud console, review the details for a machine deployed by the compute machine set and verify that the `Type` field matches the configured disk type.
