= Understanding workload hints

The following table describes how combinations of power consumption and real-time settings impact on latency.
[NOTE]
====
The following workload hints can be configured manually. You can also work with workload hints using the Performance Profile Creator. For more information about the performance profile, see the "Creating a performance profile" section.

|===
    | Performance Profile creator setting| Hint | Environment | Description

    | Default
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realTime: false
----
    | High throughput cluster without latency requirements
    | Performance achieved through CPU partitioning only.



    | Low-latency
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: false
realTime: true
----
    | Regional datacenters
    | Both energy savings and low-latency are desirable: compromise between power management, latency and throughput.


    | Ultra-low-latency
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
highPowerConsumption: true
realTime: true
----
    | Far edge clusters, latency critical workloads
    | Optimized for absolute minimal latency and maximum determinism at the cost of increased power consumption.

    | Per-pod power management
    a|[source,terminal]
----
workloadHints:
realTime: true
highPowerConsumption: false
perPodPowerManagement: true
----
    | Critical and non-critical workloads
    | Allows for power management per pod.
