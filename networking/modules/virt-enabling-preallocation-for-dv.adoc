= Enabling preallocation for a data volume

You can enable preallocation for specific data volumes by including the `spec.preallocation` field in the data volume manifest. You can enable preallocation mode in either the web console or by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

Preallocation mode is supported for all CDI source types.

.Procedure

* Specify the `spec.preallocation` field in the data volume manifest:

    ...
  pvc:
