= Broker types

Cluster administrators can set the default broker implementation for a cluster. When you create a broker, the default broker implementation is used, unless you provide set configurations in the `Broker` object.

[id="serverless-broker-types-default_{context}"]
== Default broker implementation for development purposes

Knative provides a default, channel-based broker implementation. This channel-based broker can be used for development and testing purposes, but does not provide adequate event delivery guarantees for production environments. The default broker is backed by the `InMemoryChannel` channel implementation by default.

If you want to use Kafka to reduce network hops, use the Kafka broker implementation. Do not configure the channel-based broker to be backed by the `KafkaChannel` channel implementation.
