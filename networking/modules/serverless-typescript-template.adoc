= TypeScript function template structure

When you create a TypeScript function using the Knative (`kn`) CLI, the project directory looks like a typical TypeScript project. The only exception is the additional `func.yaml` file, which is used for configuring the function.

Both `http` and `event` trigger functions have the same template structure:

.Template structure
[source,terminal]
----
.
├── func.yaml <1>
├── package.json <2>
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── index.ts <3>
├── test <4>
│   ├── integration.ts
│   └── unit.ts
└── tsconfig.json
----
<1> The `func.yaml` configuration file is used to determine the image name and registry.
<2> You are not restricted to the dependencies provided in the template `package.json` file. You can add additional dependencies as you would in any other TypeScript project.

.Example of adding npm dependencies
[source,terminal]
----
npm install --save opossum

When the project is built for deployment, these dependencies are included in the created runtime container image.
<3> Your project must contain an `src/index.js` file which exports a function named `handle`.
<4> Integration and unit test scripts are provided as part of the function template.
