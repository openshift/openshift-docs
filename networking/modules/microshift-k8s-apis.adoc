= {product-title} Kubernetes APIs

The Kubernetes API is fully accessible within {product-title} and can be managed with the `kubectl` command-line tool or the {OCP} CLI tool (`oc`). The `oc` binary is compatible with `kubectl` and offers a set of features that can be used with {product-title}. Installing both tools to use with {product-title} can help you access all of the resources you need to work with your deployments.
