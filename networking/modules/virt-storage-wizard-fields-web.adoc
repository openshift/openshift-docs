.6+|Source
|Blank (creates PVC)
|Create an empty disk.

|Import via URL (creates PVC)
|Import content via URL (HTTP or HTTPS endpoint).

|Use an existing PVC
|Use a PVC that is already available in the cluster.

|Clone existing PVC (creates PVC)
|Select an existing PVC available in the cluster and clone it.

|Import via Registry (creates PVC)
|Import content via container registry.

|Container (ephemeral)
|Upload content from a container located in a registry accessible from the cluster. The container disk should be used only for read-only filesystems such as CD-ROMs or temporary virtual machines.

|Name
|
|Name of the disk. The name can contain lowercase letters (`a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), hyphens (`-`), and periods (`.`), up to a maximum of 253 characters. The first and last characters must be alphanumeric. The name must not contain uppercase letters, spaces, or special characters.

|Size
|
|Size of the disk in GiB.

|Type
|
|Type of disk. Example: Disk or CD-ROM

|Interface
|
|Type of disk device. Supported interfaces are *virtIO*, *SATA*, and *SCSI*.

|Storage Class

== Advanced storage settings

The following advanced storage settings are optional and available for *Blank*, *Import via URL*, and *Clone existing PVC* disks.  Before {VirtProductName} 4.11, if you do not specify these parameters, the system uses the default values from the `kubevirt-storage-class-defaults` config map. In {VirtProductName} 4.11 and later, the system uses the default values from the xref:../../virt/virtual_machines/virtual_disks/virt-creating-data-volumes.adoc#virt-customizing-storage-profile_virt-creating-data-volumes[storage profile].

[NOTE]
====
Use storage profiles to ensure consistent advanced storage settings when provisioning storage for {VirtProductName}.

To manually specify *Volume Mode* and *Access Mode*, you must clear the *Apply optimized StorageProfile settings* checkbox, which is selected by default.

.2+|Volume Mode

.2+|Defines whether the persistent volume uses a formatted file system or raw block state. Default is *Filesystem*.
|Filesystem
|Stores the virtual disk on a file system-based volume.
|Block
|Stores the virtual disk directly on the block volume. Only use `Block` if the underlying storage supports it.
.3+|Access Mode
.3+|Access mode of the persistent volume.
|ReadWriteOnce (RWO)
|Volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
|ReadWriteMany (RWX)
|Volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes at one time.
[NOTE]
====
This is required for some features, such as live migration of virtual machines between nodes.
====
|ReadOnlyMany (ROX)
|Volume can be mounted as read only by many nodes.
