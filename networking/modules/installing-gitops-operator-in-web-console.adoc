{gitops-title} will be installed in all namespaces of the cluster.

After the {gitops-title} Operator is installed, it automatically sets up a ready-to-use Argo CD instance that is available in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, and an Argo CD icon is displayed in the console toolbar.
You can create subsequent Argo CD instances for your applications under your projects.
