[id="nw-ovn-ipsec-disable_{context}"]
= Disabling IPsec encryption

As a cluster administrator, you can disable IPsec encryption only if you enabled IPsec after cluster installation.

[NOTE]
====
If you enabled IPsec when you installed your cluster, you cannot disable IPsec with this procedure.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in to the cluster with a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. To disable IPsec encryption, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch networks.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type=json \
  -p='[{"op":"remove", "path":"/spec/defaultNetwork/ovnKubernetesConfig/ipsecConfig"}]'
----

. Optional: You can increase the size of your cluster MTU by `46` bytes because there is no longer any overhead from the IPsec ESP header in IP packets.
