= Integration between shared resources, Insights Operator, and {product-title} Builds

[role="_abstract"]
Integration between shared resources, Insights Operator, and {product-title} Builds makes using Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) easier in {product-title} Builds.

Previously, in {product-title} 4.9.x and earlier, you manually imported your credentials and copied them to each project or namespace where you were running builds.

Now, in {product-title} 4.10 and later, {product-title} Builds can use Red Hat subscriptions (RHEL entitlements) by referencing shared resources and the simple content access feature provided by Insights Operator:

* The simple content access feature imports your subscription credentials to a well-known `Secret` object. See the links in the following "Additional resources" section.
* The cluster administrator creates a `SharedSecret` custom resource (CR) instance around that `Secret` object and grants permission to particular projects or namespaces. In particular, the cluster administrator gives the `builder` service account permission to use that `SharedSecret` CR instance.
* Builds that run within those projects or namespaces can mount a CSI Volume that references the `SharedSecret` CR instance and its entitled RHEL content.
