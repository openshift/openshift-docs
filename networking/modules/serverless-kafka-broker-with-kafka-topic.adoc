= Creating a Kafka broker that uses an externally managed Kafka topic

If you want to use a Kafka broker without allowing it to create its own internal topic, you can use an externally managed Kafka topic instead. To do this, you must create a Kafka `Broker` object that uses the `kafka.eventing.knative.dev/external.topic` annotation.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName}, Knative Eventing, and the `KnativeKafka` custom resource are installed on your {product-title} cluster.

* You have access to a Kafka instance such as link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.6/html/amq_streams_on_openshift_overview/kafka-concepts_str#kafka-concepts-key_str[Red Hat AMQ Streams], and have created a Kafka topic.

* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Create a Kafka-based broker as a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  annotations:
    eventing.knative.dev/broker.class: Kafka <1>
    kafka.eventing.knative.dev/external.topic: <topic_name> <2>
...
----
<1> The broker class. If not specified, brokers use the default class as configured by cluster administrators. To use the Kafka broker, this value must be `Kafka`.
<2> The name of the Kafka topic that you want to use.

. Apply the Kafka-based broker YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
