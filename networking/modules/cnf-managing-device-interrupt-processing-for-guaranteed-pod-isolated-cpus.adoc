= Managing device interrupt processing for guaranteed pod isolated CPUs

The Node Tuning Operator can manage host CPUs by dividing them into reserved CPUs for cluster and operating system housekeeping duties, including pod infra containers, and isolated CPUs for application containers to run the workloads. This allows you to set CPUs for low latency workloads as isolated.

Device interrupts are load balanced between all isolated and reserved CPUs to avoid CPUs being overloaded, with the exception of CPUs where there is a guaranteed pod running. Guaranteed pod CPUs are prevented from processing device interrupts when the relevant annotations are set for the pod.

In the performance profile, `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is used to manage whether device interrupts are processed or not. For certain workloads, the reserved CPUs are not always sufficient for dealing with device interrupts, and for this reason, device interrupts are not globally disabled on the isolated CPUs. By default, Node Tuning Operator does not disable device interrupts on isolated CPUs.

To achieve low latency for workloads, some (but not all) pods require the CPUs they are running on to not process device interrupts. A pod annotation, `irq-load-balancing.crio.io`, is used to define whether device interrupts are processed or not. When configured, CRI-O disables device interrupts only as long as the pod is running.

[id="disabling-cpu-cfs-quota_{context}"]
== Disabling CPU CFS quota

To reduce CPU throttling for individual guaranteed pods, create a pod specification with the annotation `cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"`. This annotation disables the CPU completely fair scheduler (CFS) quota at the pod run time. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      cpu-quota.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
----

[NOTE]
====
Only disable CPU CFS quota when the CPU manager static policy is enabled and for pods with guaranteed QoS that use whole CPUs. Otherwise, disabling CPU CFS quota can affect the performance of other containers in the cluster.

[id="configuring-global-device-interrupts-handling-for-isolated-cpus_{context}"]
== Disabling global device interrupts handling in Node Tuning Operator

To configure Node Tuning Operator to disable global device interrupts for the isolated CPU set, set the `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` field in the performance profile to `true`. When `true`, conflicting pod annotations are ignored. When `false`, IRQ loads are balanced across all CPUs.

A performance profile snippet illustrates this setting:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: PerformanceProfile
metadata:
  name: manual
spec:
  globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing: true
...
----

[id="disabling_interrupt_processing_for_individual_pods_{context}"]
== Disabling interrupt processing for individual pods

To disable interrupt processing for individual pods, ensure that `globallyDisableIrqLoadBalancing` is set to `false` in the performance profile. Then, in the pod specification, set the `irq-load-balancing.crio.io` pod annotation to `disable`. The following pod specification contains this annotation:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: performance.openshift.io/v2
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
      irq-load-balancing.crio.io: "disable"
spec:
    runtimeClassName: performance-<profile_name>
...
