== Meaning

This alert fires when a JSON Patch annotation is used to change an operand
of the HyperConverged Cluster Operator (HCO).

HCO configures {VirtProductName} and its supporting operators in
an opinionated way and overwrites its operands when there is an unexpected
change to them. Users must not modify the operands directly.

However, if a change is required and it is not supported by the HCO API,
you can force HCO to set a change in an operator by using JSON Patch annotations.
These changes are not reverted by HCO during its reconciliation process.

== Impact

Incorrect use of JSON Patch annotations might lead to unexpected results
or an unstable environment.

Upgrading a system with JSON Patch annotations is dangerous because the
structure of the component custom resources might change.

== Mitigation

It is best to use the HCO API to change an operand. However, if the change
can only be done with a JSON Patch annotation, proceed with caution.

Remove JSON Patch annotations before upgrade to avoid potential issues.
