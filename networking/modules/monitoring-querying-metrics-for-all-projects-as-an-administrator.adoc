= Querying metrics for all projects as a cluster administrator

As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can access metrics for all default {product-title} and user-defined projects in the Metrics UI.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role or with view permissions for all projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. Select the *Administrator* perspective in the {product-title} web console.

. Select *Observe* -> *Metrics*.

. Select *Insert Metric at Cursor* to view a list of predefined queries.

. To create a custom query, add your Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query to the *Expression* field.
+
[NOTE]
====
As you type a PromQL expression, autocomplete suggestions appear in a drop-down list.
These suggestions include functions, metrics, labels, and time tokens.
You can use the keyboard arrows to select one of these suggested items and then press Enter to add the item to your expression.
You can also move your mouse pointer over a suggested item to view a brief description of that item.
====

. To add multiple queries, select *Add Query*.

. To duplicate an existing query, select {kebab} next to the query, then choose *Duplicate query*.

. To delete a query, select {kebab} next to the query, then choose *Delete query*.

. To disable a query from being run, select {kebab} next to the query and choose *Disable query*.

. To run queries that you created, select *Run Queries*. 
The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot. 
If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.
+
[NOTE]
====
Queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser when drawing time series graphs. To avoid this, select *Hide graph* and calibrate your query using only the metrics table. Then, after finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.

. Optional: The page URL now contains the queries you ran. To use this set of queries again in the future, save this URL.
