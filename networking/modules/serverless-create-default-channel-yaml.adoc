= Creating a default implementation channel by using YAML

Creating Knative resources by using YAML files uses a declarative API, which enables you to describe channels declaratively and in a reproducible manner. To create a serverless channel by using YAML, you must create a YAML file that defines a `Channel` object, then apply it by using the `oc apply` command.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {product-title}.

.Procedure

. Create a `Channel` object as a YAML file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
----

. Apply the YAML file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----
