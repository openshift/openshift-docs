= Indication of done for ZTP installations

Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) simplifies the process of checking the ZTP installation status for a cluster. The ZTP status moves through three phases: cluster installation, cluster configuration, and ZTP done.

Cluster installation phase::
The cluster installation phase is shown by the `ManagedClusterJoined` and  `ManagedClusterAvailable` conditions in the `ManagedCluster` CR . If the `ManagedCluster` CR does not have these conditions, or the condition is set to `False`, the cluster is still in the installation phase. Additional details about installation are available from the `AgentClusterInstall` and `ClusterDeployment` CRs. For more information, see "Troubleshooting GitOps ZTP".

Cluster configuration phase::
The cluster configuration phase is shown by a `ztp-running` label applied the `ManagedCluster` CR for the cluster.

ZTP done::
Cluster installation and configuration is complete in the ZTP done phase. This is shown by the removal of the `ztp-running` label and addition of the `ztp-done` label to the `ManagedCluster` CR. The `ztp-done` label shows that the configuration has been applied and the baseline DU configuration has completed cluster tuning.
+
The transition to the ZTP done state is conditional on the compliant state of a {rh-rhacm-first} validator inform policy. This policy captures the existing criteria for a completed installation and validates that it moves to a compliant state only when ZTP provisioning of the managed cluster is complete.
+
The validator inform policy ensures the configuration of the cluster is fully applied and Operators have completed their initialization. The policy validates the following:
+
* The target `MachineConfigPool` contains the expected entries and has finished updating. All nodes are available and not degraded.

* The SR-IOV Operator has completed initialization as indicated by at least one `SriovNetworkNodeState` with `syncStatus: Succeeded`.

* The PTP Operator daemon set exists.
