= Formatting VMware vSphere volumes

Before {product-title} mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks that the volume contains a file system that is specified by the `fsType` parameter value in the `PersistentVolume` (PV) definition. If the device is not formatted with the file system, all data from the device is erased, and the device is automatically formatted with the specified file system.

Because {product-title} formats them before the first use, you can use unformatted vSphere volumes as PVs.
