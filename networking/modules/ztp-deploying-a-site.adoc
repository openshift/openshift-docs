[id="ztp-deploying-a-site_{context}"]
= Deploying a managed cluster with SiteConfig and ZTP

Use the following procedure to create a `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) and related files and initiate the zero touch provisioning (ZTP) cluster deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

* You have logged in to the hub cluster as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

* You configured the hub cluster for generating the required installation and policy CRs.

* You created a Git repository where you manage your custom site configuration data. The repository must be accessible from the hub cluster and you must configure it as a source repository for the ArgoCD application. See "Preparing the GitOps ZTP site configuration repository" for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
When you create the source repository, ensure that you patch the ArgoCD application with the `argocd/deployment/argocd-openshift-gitops-patch.json` patch-file that you extract from the `ztp-site-generate` container. See "Configuring the hub cluster with ArgoCD".
====

* To be ready for provisioning managed clusters, you require the following for each bare-metal host:
+
Network connectivity:: Your network requires DNS. Managed cluster hosts should be reachable from the hub cluster. Ensure that Layer 3 connectivity exists between the hub cluster and the managed cluster host.
+
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) details:: ZTP uses BMC username and password details to connect to the BMC during cluster installation. The GitOps ZTP plugin manages the `ManagedCluster` CRs on the hub cluster based on the `SiteConfig` CR in your site Git repo. You create individual `BMCSecret` CRs for each host manually.

.Procedure

. Create the required managed cluster secrets on the hub cluster. These resources must be in a namespace with a name matching the cluster name. For example, in `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/example-sno.yaml`, the cluster name and namespace is `example-sno`.

.. Export the cluster namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export CLUSTERNS=example-sno
----

.. Create the namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create namespace $CLUSTERNS
----

. Create pull secret and BMC `Secret` CRs for the managed cluster. The pull secret must contain all the credentials necessary for installing {product-title} and all required Operators. See "Creating the managed bare-metal host secrets" for more information.
+
[NOTE]
====
The secrets are referenced from the `SiteConfig` custom resource (CR) by name. The namespace
must match the `SiteConfig` namespace.
====

. Create a `SiteConfig` CR for your cluster in your local clone of the Git repository:

.. Choose the appropriate example for your CR from the  `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/` folder.
The folder includes example files for single node, three-node, and standard clusters:
+
*** `example-sno.yaml`
*** `example-3node.yaml`
*** `example-standard.yaml`

.. Change the cluster and host details in the example file to match the type of cluster you want. For example:
+
include::snippets/ztp-example-siteconfig.adoc[]
+
[NOTE]
====
For more information about BMC addressing, see the "Additional resources" section.
====

.. You can inspect the default set of extra-manifest `MachineConfig` CRs in `out/argocd/extra-manifest`. It is automatically applied to the cluster when it is installed.

.. Optional: To provision additional install-time manifests on the provisioned cluster, create a directory in your Git repository, for example, `sno-extra-manifest/`, and add your custom manifest CRs to this directory. If your `SiteConfig.yaml` refers to this directory in the `extraManifestPath` field, any CRs in this referenced directory are appended to the default set of extra manifests.

. Add the `SiteConfig` CR to the `kustomization.yaml` file in the `generators` section, similar to the example shown in `out/argocd/example/siteconfig/kustomization.yaml`.

. Commit the `SiteConfig` CR and associated `kustomization.yaml` changes in your Git repository and push the changes.
+
The ArgoCD pipeline detects the changes and begins the managed cluster deployment.
