== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the logging collector included a path as a label for the metrics it produced. This path changed frequently and contributed to significant storage changes for the Prometheus server. With this update, the label has been dropped to resolve the issue and reduce storage consumption. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2682[LOG-2682])
