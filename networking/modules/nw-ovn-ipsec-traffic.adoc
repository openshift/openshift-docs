= Types of network traffic flows encrypted by IPsec

With IPsec enabled, only the following network traffic flows between pods are encrypted:

* Traffic between pods on different nodes on the cluster network
* Traffic from a pod on the host network to a pod on the cluster network

The following traffic flows are not encrypted:

* Traffic between pods on the same node on the cluster network
* Traffic between pods on the host network
* Traffic from a pod on the cluster network to a pod on the host network

The encrypted and unencrypted flows are illustrated in the following diagram:

== Network connectivity requirements when IPsec is enabled

You must configure the network connectivity between machines to allow {product-title} cluster
components to communicate. Each machine must be able to resolve the hostnames
of all other machines in the cluster.
