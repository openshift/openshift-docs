= Configuring pod topology spread constraints

The following steps demonstrate how to configure pod topology spread constraints to distribute pods that match the specified labels based on their zone.

You can specify multiple pod topology spread constraints, but you must ensure that they do not conflict with each other. All pod topology spread constraints must be satisfied for a pod to be placed.

.Prerequisites

* A cluster administrator has added the required labels to nodes.

.Procedure

. Create a `Pod` spec and specify a pod topology spread constraint:
+
.Example `pod-spec.yaml` file
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    foo: bar
spec:
  topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1 <1>
    topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone <2>
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule <3>
    labelSelector: <4>
      matchLabels:
        foo: bar <5>
  containers:
  - image: "docker.io/ocpqe/hello-pod"
    name: hello-pod
----
<1> The maximum difference in number of pods between any two topology domains. The default is `1`, and you cannot specify a value of `0`.
<2> The key of a node label. Nodes with this key and identical value are considered to be in the same topology.
<3> How to handle a pod if it does not satisfy the spread constraint. The default is `DoNotSchedule`, which tells the scheduler not to schedule the pod. Set to `ScheduleAnyway` to still schedule the pod, but the scheduler prioritizes honoring the skew to not make the cluster more imbalanced.
<4> Pods that match this label selector are counted and recognized as a group when spreading to satisfy the constraint. Be sure to specify a label selector, otherwise no pods can be matched.
<5> Be sure that this `Pod` spec also sets its labels to match this label selector if you want it to be counted properly in the future.

. Create the pod:

$ oc create -f pod-spec.yaml
