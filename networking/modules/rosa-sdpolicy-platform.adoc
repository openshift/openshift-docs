= Platform
:productwinc: Red Hat OpenShift support for Windows Containers

This section provides information about the service definition for the {product-title} (ROSA) platform.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-backup-policy_{context}"]
== Cluster backup policy

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is critical that customers have a backup plan for their applications and application data.
====

Application and application data backups are not a part of the {product-title} service.
The following table outlines the cluster backup policy.

//Verify if the corresponding tables in policy-incident.adoc and rosa-policy-incident.adoc also need to be updated.

[cols= "3a,2a,2a,3a",options="header"]

|===
|Component
|Snapshot frequency
|Retention
|Notes

.2+|Full object store backup, all cluster persistent volumes (PVs)
|Daily
|7 days
.2+|This is a full backup of all Kubernetes objects like etcd, as well as all PVs in the cluster.

|Weekly
|30 days


|Full object store backup
|Hourly
|24 hour
|This is a full backup of all Kubernetes objects like etcd. No PVs are backed up in this backup schedule.

|Node root volume
|Never
|N/A
|Nodes are considered to be short-term. Nothing critical should be stored on a node's root volume.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-autoscaling_{context}"]
== Autoscaling
Node autoscaling is available on {product-title}. You can configure the autoscaler option to automatically scale the number of machines in a cluster.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-daemonsets_{context}"]
== Daemonsets
Customers can create and run daemonsets on {product-title}. To restrict daemonsets to only running on worker nodes, use the following `nodeSelector`:
[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    role: worker
...
----

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-multiple-availability-zone_{context}"]
== Multiple availability zone
In a multiple availability zone cluster, control plane nodes are distributed across availability zones and at least one worker node is required in each availability zone.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-node-labels_{context}"]
== Node labels
Custom node labels are created by Red Hat during node creation and cannot be changed on {product-title} clusters at this time. However, custom labels are supported when creating new machine pools.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-openshift-version_{context}"]
== OpenShift version
{product-title} is run as a service and is kept up to date with the latest OpenShift Container Platform version. Upgrade scheduling to the latest version is available.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-upgrades_{context}"]
== Upgrades
Upgrades can be scheduled using the `rosa` CLI utility or through {cluster-manager}.

See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_policy/rosa-life-cycle.html[{product-title} Life Cycle] for more information on the upgrade policy and procedures.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-window-containers_{context}"]
== Windows Containers
{productwinc} is not available on {product-title} at this time.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-container-engine_{context}"]
== Container engine
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openshift-container-platform-4-now-defaults-cri-o-underlying-container-engine[CRI-O] as the only available container engine.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-operating-system_{context}"]
== Operating system
{product-title} runs on OpenShift 4 and uses Red Hat CoreOS as the operating system for all control plane and worker nodes.

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-red-hat-operator_{context}"]
== Red Hat Operator support
Red Hat workloads typically refer to Red Hat-provided Operators made available through Operator Hub. Red Hat workloads are not managed by the Red Hat SRE team, and must be deployed on worker nodes. These Operators may require additional Red Hat subscriptions, and may incur additional cloud infrastructure costs. Examples of these Red Hat-provided Operators are:

* {rhq-short}
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security
* {SMProductName} 
* {ServerlessProductName} 
* {logging-sd}
* {pipelines-title}

[id="rosa-sdpolicy-kubernetes-operator_{context}"]
== Kubernetes Operator support
All Operators listed in the Operator Hub marketplace should be available for installation. These operators are considered customer workloads, and are not monitored by Red Hat SRE.
