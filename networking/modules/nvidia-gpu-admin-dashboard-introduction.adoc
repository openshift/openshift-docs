= Introduction

The OpenShift Console NVIDIA GPU plugin is a dedicated administration dashboard for NVIDIA GPU usage visualization
in the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) Console. The visualizations in the administration dashboard provide guidance on how to
best optimize GPU resources in clusters, such as when a GPU is under- or over-utilized.

The OpenShift Console NVIDIA GPU plugin works as a remote bundle for the OCP console.
To run the plugin the OCP console must be running.
