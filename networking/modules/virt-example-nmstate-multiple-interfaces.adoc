= Example: Multiple interfaces in the same node network configuration policy

You can create multiple interfaces in the same node network configuration policy. These interfaces can reference each other, allowing you to build and deploy a network configuration by using a single policy manifest.

The following example snippet creates a bond that is named `bond10` across two NICs and a Linux bridge that is named `br1` that connects to the bond.
