= Filtering the network traffic
By default, the Network Traffic page displays the traffic flow data in the cluster based on the default filters configured in the `FlowCollector` instance. You can use the filter options to observe the required data by changing the preset filter.


Quick filters::
The default values in *Quick filters* drop-down menu are defined in the `FlowCollector` configuration. You can modify the options from console. 

Advanced filters::
You can set the advanced filters by providing the parameter to be filtered and its corresponding text value. The section *Common* in the parameter drop-down list filters the results that match either *Source* or *Destination*. To enable or disable the applied filter, you can click on the applied filter listed below the filter options.

[NOTE]

To understand the rules of specifying the text value, click *Learn More*.

Query Options::
You can use *Query Options* to optimize the search results, as listed below:

** *Reporter Node*: Every flow can be reported from both source and destination nodes. For cluster ingress, the flow is reported from the destination node and for cluster egress, the flow is reported from the source node. You can select either *Source* or *Destination*. The option *Both* is disabled for the *Overview* and *Topology* view. The default selected value is *Destination*.
** *Match filters*: You can determine the relation between different filter parameters selected in the advanced filter. The available options are *Match all* and *Match any*. *Match all*  provides results that match all the values, and *Match any* provides results that match any of the values entered. The default value is *Match all*.
** *Limit*: The data limit for internal backend queries. Depending upon the matching and the filter settings, the number of traffic flow data is displayed within the specified limit.

You can click *Reset default filter* to remove the existing filters, and apply the filter defined in `FlowCollector` configuration.
