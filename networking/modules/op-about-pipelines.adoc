= Pipelines

A _Pipeline_ is a collection of `Task` resources arranged in a specific order of execution. They are executed to construct complex workflows that automate the build, deployment and delivery of applications. You can define a CI/CD workflow for your application using pipelines containing one or more tasks.

A `Pipeline` resource definition consists of a number of fields or attributes, which together enable the pipeline to accomplish a specific goal. Each `Pipeline` resource definition must contain at least one `Task` resource, which ingests specific inputs and produces specific outputs. The pipeline definition can also optionally include _Conditions_, _Workspaces_, _Parameters_, or _Resources_ depending on the application requirements.

The following example shows the `build-and-deploy` pipeline, which builds an application image from a Git repository using the `buildah` `ClusterTask` resource:

----
<1> Pipeline API version `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `Pipeline`.
<3> Unique name of this Pipeline.
<4> Specifies the definition and structure of the Pipeline.
<5> Workspaces used across all the Tasks in the Pipeline.
<6> Parameters used across all the Tasks in the Pipeline.
<7> Specifies the list of Tasks used in the Pipeline.
<8> Task `build-image`, which uses the `buildah` ClusterTask to build application images from a given Git repository.
<9> Task `apply-manifests`, which uses a user-defined Task with the same name.
<10> Specifies the sequence in which Tasks are run in a Pipeline. In this example, the `apply-manifests` Task is run only after the `build-image` Task is completed.

[NOTE]
====
The {pipelines-title} Operator installs the Buildah cluster task and creates the `pipeline` service account with sufficient permission to build and push an image. The Buildah cluster task can fail when associated with a different service account with insufficient permissions.
