= Verifying online snapshot creation with snapshot indications

Snapshot indications are contextual information about online virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are not available for offline virtual machine (VM) snapshot operations. Indications are helpful in describing details about the online snapshot creation.

.Prerequisites

* To view indications, you must have attempted to create an online VM snapshot using the CLI or the web console.

.Procedure

. Display the output from the snapshot indications by doing one of the following:
* For snapshots created with the CLI, view indicator output in the `VirtualMachineSnapshot` object YAML, in the *status* field.
* For snapshots created using the web console, click *VirtualMachineSnapshot > Status* in the *Snapshot details* screen.
. Verify the status of your online VM snapshot:
* `Online` indicates that the VM was running during online snapshot creation.
* `NoGuestAgent` indicates that the QEMU guest agent was not running during online snapshot creation. The QEMU guest agent could not be used to freeze and thaw the file system, either because the QEMU guest agent was not installed or running or due to another error.
