= Logging in and verifying permissions

You can log in as an {product-title} cluster administration via the web console
or CLI, just as you would if you were an application developer.

When you log in to the web console, all user-created projects across the cluster
are visible from the main *Projects* page.

Use the standard `oc login` command to log in with the CLI:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc login <your_instance_url>
----

All projects are visible using:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get projects
----

When your account has the `dedicated-admins-cluster` cluster role bound to it,
you are automatically bound to the `dedicated-admins-project` for any new
projects that are created by users in the cluster.

To verify if your account has administrator privileges, run the following
command against a user-created project to view its default role bindings. If you
are a cluster administrator, you will see your account listed under subjects for
the `dedicated-admins-project-0` and `dedicated-admins-project-1` role bindings
for the project:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe rolebinding.rbac -n <project_name>
----
