== Bug fixes
* Before this update, Kibana had a fixed `24h` OAuth cookie expiration time, which resulted in 401 errors in Kibana whenever the `accessTokenInactivityTimeout` field was set to a value lower than `24h`. With this update, Kibana's OAuth cookie expiration time synchronizes to the `accessTokenInactivityTimeout`, with a default value of `24h`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3305[LOG-3305])

* Before this update, Vector parsed the message field when JSON  parsing was enabled without also defining `structuredTypeKey` or `structuredTypeName` values. With this update, a value is required for either  `structuredTypeKey` or `structuredTypeName` when writing structured logs to Elasticsearch. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3284[LOG-3284])

* Before this update, the `FluentdQueueLengthIncreasing` alert could fail to fire when there was a cardinality issue with the set of labels returned from this alert expression. This update reduces labels to only include those required for the alert. (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3226[LOG-3226])

* Before this update, Loki did not have support to reach an external storage in a disconnected cluster. With this update,  proxy environment variables and proxy trusted CA bundles are included in the container image to support these connections. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-2860[LOG-2860])

* Before this update, {product-title} web console users could not choose the `ConfigMap` object that includes the CA certificate for Loki, causing pods to operate without the CA. With this update, web console users can select the config map, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3310[LOG-3310])

* Before this update, the CA key was used as volume name for mounting the CA into Loki, causing error states when the CA Key included non-conforming characters (such as dots). With this update, the volume name is standardized to an internal string which resolves the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-3332[LOG-3332])
