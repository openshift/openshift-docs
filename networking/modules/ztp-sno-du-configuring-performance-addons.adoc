= Performance profile

{sno-caps} clusters that run DU workloads require a Node Tuning Operator performance profile to use real-time host capabilities and services.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator was used to implement automatic tuning to achieve low latency performance for OpenShift applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator.

The following example `PerformanceProfile` CR illustrates the required cluster configuration.
