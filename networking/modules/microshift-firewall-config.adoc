= Using a firewall

Firewalls are not required in {product-title}, but using a firewall can prevent undesired access to the {product-title} API. When using a firewall, you must explicitly allow the following OVN-Kubernetes traffic when the `firewalld` service is running:

CNI pod to CNI pod::
CNI pod to Host-Network pod
Host-Network pod to Host-Network pod

CNI pod::
The Kubernetes pod that uses the CNI network

Host-Network pod::
The Kubernetes pod that uses host network
 Install and configure the `firewalld` service by using the following procedures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{product-title} pods must have access to the internal CoreDNS component and API servers.
