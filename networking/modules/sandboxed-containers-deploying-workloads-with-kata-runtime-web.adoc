[id="sandboxed-containers-deploying-workloads-with-kata-runtime-web_{context}"]
= Deploying a workload in a sandboxed container using the web console

{sandboxed-containers-first} installs Kata as a secondary, optional runtime on your cluster, and not as the primary runtime.

To deploy a pod-templated workload in a sandboxed container, you must manually add `kata` as the `runtimeClassName` to the workload YAML file.

.Prerequisites

* You have installed {product-title} {product-version} on your cluster.
* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* You have installed the {sandboxed-containers-operator}.
* You have created a `KataConfig` custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective in the web console, expand *Workloads* and select the type of workload you want to create.

. In the workload page, click to create the workload.

. In the YAML file for the workload, in the *spec* field where the container is listed, add `runtimeClassName: kata`.
