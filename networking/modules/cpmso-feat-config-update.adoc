= Updating the control plane configuration

You can make changes to the configuration of the machines in the control plane by updating the specification in the control plane machine set custom resource (CR).

The Control Plane Machine Set Operator monitors the control plane machines and compares their configuration with the specification in the control plane machine set CR. When there is a discrepancy between the specification in the CR and the configuration of a control plane machine, the Operator marks that control plane machine for replacement.

[NOTE]
====
For more information about the parameters in the CR, see "Control Plane Machine Set Operator configuration".

.Prerequisites

* Your cluster has an activated and functioning Control Plane Machine Set Operator.

.Procedure

. Edit your control plane machine set CR by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc --namespace openshift-machine-api edit controlplanemachineset.machine.openshift.io cluster
----

. Change the values of any fields that you want to update in your cluster configuration.

. Save your changes.

.Next steps

* For clusters that use the default `RollingUpdate` update strategy, the Operator automatically propagates the changes to your control plane configuration.

* For clusters that are configured to use the `OnDelete` update strategy, you must replace your control plane machines manually.
