[id="builds-restricting-build-strategy-globally_{context}"]
= Restricting build strategies to users globally

You can allow a set of specific users to create builds with a particular strategy.

.Prerequisites

* Disable global access to the build strategy.

.Procedure

* Assign the role that corresponds to the build strategy to a specific user. For
example, to add the `system:build-strategy-docker` cluster role to the user
`devuser`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user system:build-strategy-docker devuser
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Granting a user access at the cluster level to the `builds/docker` subresource means that the user can create builds with the docker strategy in any project in which they can create builds.
