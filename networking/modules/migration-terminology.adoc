|Term |Definition
|Source cluster |Cluster from which the applications are migrated.
|Destination cluster^[1]^ |Cluster to which the applications are migrated.
|Replication repository |Object storage used for copying images, volumes, and Kubernetes objects during indirect migration or for Kubernetes objects during direct volume migration or direct image migration.

The replication repository must be accessible to all clusters.

|Host cluster |Cluster on which the `migration-controller` pod and the web console are running. The host cluster is usually the destination cluster but this is not required.

The host cluster does not require an exposed registry route for direct image migration.
|Remote cluster |A remote cluster is usually the source cluster but this is not required.

A remote cluster requires a `Secret` custom resource that contains the `migration-controller` service account token.

A remote cluster requires an exposed secure registry route for direct image migration.

|Indirect migration |Images, volumes, and Kubernetes objects are copied from the source cluster to the replication repository and then from the replication repository to the destination cluster.
|Direct volume migration |Persistent volumes are copied directly from the source cluster to the destination cluster.
|Direct image migration |Images are copied directly from the source cluster to the destination cluster.
|Stage migration |Data is copied to the destination cluster without stopping the application.

Running a stage migration multiple times reduces the duration of the cutover migration.
|Cutover migration |The application is stopped on the source cluster and its resources are migrated to the destination cluster.
|State migration |Application state is migrated by copying specific persistent volume claims to the destination cluster.
|Rollback migration |Rollback migration rolls back a completed migration.

^1^  Called the _target_ cluster in the {mtc-short} web console.
