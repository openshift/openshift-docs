[discrete]
[id="meaning-lowvirtapicount_{context}"]
== Meaning

This alert fires when only one available `virt-api` pod is detected during a
60-minute period, although at least two nodes are available for scheduling.

[discrete]
[id="impact-lowvirtapicount_{context}"]
== Impact

An API call outage might occur during node eviction because the `virt-api` pod
becomes a single point of failure.

== Diagnosis

. Set the `NAMESPACE` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export NAMESPACE="$(oc get kubevirt -A \
  -o custom-columns="":.metadata.namespace)"
----

. Check the number of available `virt-api` pods:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get deployment -n $NAMESPACE virt-api \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.readyReplicas}'
----

. Check the status of the `virt-api` deployment for error conditions:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n $NAMESPACE get deploy virt-api -o yaml
----

. Check the nodes for issues such as nodes in a `NotReady` state:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes
----
