[id="modify-unavailable-workers_{context}"]
= Modifying the number of unavailable worker nodes

By default, only one machine is allowed to be unavailable when applying the kubelet-related configuration to the available worker nodes. For a large cluster, it can take a long time for the configuration change to be reflected. At any time, you can adjust the number of machines that are updating to speed up the process.

.Procedure

. Edit the `worker` machine config pool:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineconfigpool worker
----

. Add the `maxUnavailable` field and set the value:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  maxUnavailable: <node_count>
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
When setting the value, consider the number of worker nodes that can be
unavailable without affecting the applications running on the cluster.
