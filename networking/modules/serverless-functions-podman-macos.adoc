= Setting up Podman on macOS

To use advanced container management features, you might want to use Podman with {FunctionsProductName}. To do so on macOS, you need to start the Podman machine and configure the Knative (`kn`) CLI to connect to it.

.Procedure

. Create the Podman machine:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman machine init --memory=8192 --cpus=2 --disk-size=20
----

. Start the Podman machine, which serves the Docker API on a UNIX socket:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman machine start
Starting machine "podman-machine-default"
Waiting for VM ...
Mounting volume... /Users/myuser:/Users/user

[...truncated output...]

You can still connect Docker API clients by setting DOCKER_HOST using the
following command in your terminal session:

	export DOCKER_HOST='unix:///Users/myuser/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock'

Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully
----
+
[NOTE]
====
On most macOS systems, this socket is located at `/Users/myuser/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock`.
====

. Establish the environment variable that is used to build a function:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export DOCKER_HOST='unix:///Users/myuser/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock'
----

. Run the build command inside your function project directory with the `-v` flag to see verbose output. You should see a connection to your local UNIX socket:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func build -v
----
