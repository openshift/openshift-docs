[id="gathering-data-about-your-cluster-using-must-gather_{context}"]
= Gathering data about your cluster using `must-gather`

The Performance Profile Creator (PPC) tool requires `must-gather` data. As a cluster administrator, run `must-gather` to capture information about your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
In earlier versions of {product-title}, the Performance Addon Operator provided automatic, low latency performance tuning for applications. In {product-title} 4.11 and later, this functionality is part of the Node Tuning Operator. However, you must still use the `performance-addon-operator-must-gather` image when running the `must-gather` command.
====

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* Access to the Performance Addon Operator `must gather` image.
* The OpenShift CLI (`oc`) installed.

.Procedure

. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the `must-gather` data.

. Run `must-gather` on your cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=<PAO_must_gather_image> --dest-dir=<dir>
----
+
[NOTE]
====
`must-gather` must be run with the `performance-addon-operator-must-gather` image. The output can optionally be compressed. Compressed output is required if you are running the Performance Profile Creator wrapper script.

.Example
+
[source,terminal,subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc adm must-gather --image=registry.redhat.io/openshift4/performance-addon-operator-must-gather-rhel8:v{product-version} --dest-dir=<path_to_must-gather>/must-gather
----
. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather/
----
