= Enabling swap memory use on nodes

:FeatureName: Enabling swap memory use on nodes
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can enable swap memory use for {product-title} workloads on a per-node basis.

[WARNING]
====
Enabling swap memory can negatively impact workload performance and out-of-resource handling. Do not enable swap memory on control plane nodes.
====

To enable swap memory, create a `kubeletconfig` custom resource (CR) to set the `swapbehavior` parameter. You can set limited or unlimited swap memory:

* Limited: Use the `LimitedSwap` value to limit how much swap memory workloads can use. Any workloads on the node that are not managed by {product-title} can still use swap memory. The `LimitedSwap` behavior depends on whether the node is running with Linux control groups link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v1/index.html[version 1 (cgroups v1)] or link:https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html[version 2 (cgroup v2)]:
** cgroup v1: {product-title} workloads can use any combination of memory and swap, up to the pod's memory limit, if set.
** cgroup v2: {product-title} workloads cannot use swap memory.

* Unlimited: Use the `UnlimitedSwap` value to allow workloads to use as much swap memory as they request, up to the system limit.

Because the kubelet will not start in the presence of swap memory without this configuration, you must enable swap memory in {product-title} before enabling swap memory on the nodes. If there is no swap memory present on a node, enabling swap memory in {product-title} has no effect.

.Prerequisites

* You have a running {product-title} cluster that uses version 4.10 or later.

* You are logged in to the cluster as a user with administrative privileges.

* You have enabled the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set on the cluster (see _Nodes -> Working with clusters -> Enabling features using feature gates_).
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set cannot be undone and prevents minor version updates. These feature sets are not recommended on production clusters.
====

* If cgroup v2 is enabled on a node, you must enable swap accounting on the node, by setting the `swapaccount=1` kernel argument.

.Procedure

. Apply a custom label to the machine config pool where you want to allow swap memory.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label machineconfigpool worker kubelet-swap=enabled
----

. Create a custom resource (CR) to enable and configure swap settings.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1
kind: KubeletConfig
metadata:
  name: swap-config
spec:
  machineConfigPoolSelector:
    matchLabels:
      kubelet-swap: enabled
  kubeletConfig:
    failSwapOn: false <1>
    memorySwap:
      swapBehavior: LimitedSwap <2>
----
<1> Set to `false` to enable swap memory use on the associated nodes. Set to `true` to disable swap memory use.
<2> Specify the swap memory behavior. If unspecified, the default is `LimitedSwap`.

. Enable swap memory on the machines.
