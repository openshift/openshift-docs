toc::[]

With IPsec enabled, you can encrypt both internal pod-to-pod cluster traffic between nodes and external traffic between pods and IPsec endpoints external to your cluster. All pod-to-pod network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in _Transport mode_.

IPsec is disabled by default. It can be enabled either during or after installing the cluster. For information about cluster installation, see xref:../../installing/index.adoc#ocp-installation-overview[{product-title} installation overview].

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your cluster uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-are-hosted-control-planes[{hcp}] for Red Hat {product-title}, IPsec is not supported for IPsec encryption of either pod-to-pod or traffic to external hosts.
====

[NOTE]
====
IPsec on {ibm-cloud-name} supports only NAT-T. Using ESP is not supported.
====

Use the procedures in the following documentation to:

* Enable and disable IPSec after cluster installation
* Configure IPsec encryption for traffic between the cluster and external hosts
* Verify that IPsec encrypts traffic between pods on different nodes

[id="{context}-prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

For IPsec support for encrypting traffic to external hosts, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin must be configured in local gateway mode, where `ovnKubernetesConfig.gatewayConfig.routingViaHost=true`.
* The NMState Operator is installed. This Operator is required for specifying the IPsec configuration. For more information, see xref:../../networking/k8s_nmstate/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc#k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator[About the Kubernetes NMState Operator].
+
--
[NOTE]
====
The NMState Operator is supported on {gcp-first} only for configuring IPsec.
====
--
* The Butane tool (`butane`) is installed. To install Butane, see xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-butane-install_installing-customizing[Installing Butane].

These prerequisites are required to add certificates into the host NSS database and to configure IPsec to communicate with external hosts.

[id="{context}-pod-to-pod-ipsec"]
== IPsec encryption for pod-to-pod traffic

For IPsec encryption of pod-to-pod traffic, the following sections describe which specific pod-to-pod traffic is encrypted, what kind of encryption protocol is used, and how X.509 certificates are handled. These sections do not apply to IPsec encryption between the cluster and external hosts, which you must configure manually for your specific external network infrastructure.
