= Configuring full multitenant isolation with ingress and egress network policies
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: multitenant-network-policy

toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure ingress and egress network policies to enforce full multitenant isolation between projects. This ensures that pods can only communicate with explicitly allowed services or destinations, which helps improve the security of your deployment.

[NOTE]
====
Configuring network policies as described in this section provides network isolation similar to the multitenant mode of OpenShift SDN in previous versions of {product-title}.
