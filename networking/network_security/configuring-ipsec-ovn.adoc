By enabling IPsec, you can encrypt both internal pod-to-pod cluster traffic between nodes and external traffic between pods and IPsec endpoints external to your cluster. All pod-to-pod network traffic between nodes on the OVN-Kubernetes cluster network is encrypted with IPsec in _Transport mode_.

IPsec is disabled by default. You can enable IPsec either during or after installing the cluster. For information about cluster installation, see xref:../../installing/overview/index.adoc#ocp-installation-overview[{product-title} installation overview].

The following support limitations exist for IPsec on a {product-title} cluster:

* You must disable IPsec before updating to {product-title} 4.15. There is a known issue that can cause interruptions in pod-to-pod communication if you update without disabling IPsec. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-43323[*OCPBUGS-43323*])
* On {ibm-cloud-name}, IPsec supports only NAT-T. Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is not supported on this platform.
* If your cluster uses link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-are-hosted-control-planes[{hcp}] for Red{nbsp}Hat {product-title}, IPsec is not supported for IPsec encryption of either pod-to-pod or traffic to external hosts.
* Using ESP hardware offloading on any network interface is not supported if one or more of those interfaces is attached to Open vSwitch (OVS). Enabling IPsec for your cluster triggers the use of IPsec with interfaces attached to OVS. By default, {product-title} disables ESP hardware offloading on any interfaces attached to OVS.
* If you enabled IPsec for network interfaces that are not attached to OVS, a cluster administrator must manually disable ESP hardware offloading on each interface that is not attached to OVS.

The following list outlines key tasks in the IPsec documentation:

* Enable and disable IPsec after cluster installation.
* Configure IPsec encryption for traffic between the cluster and external hosts.
* Verify that IPsec encrypts traffic between pods on different nodes.

== Prerequisites

For IPsec support for encrypting traffic to external hosts, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

* The OVN-Kubernetes network plugin must be configured in local gateway mode, where `ovnKubernetesConfig.gatewayConfig.routingViaHost=true`.
* The NMState Operator is installed. This Operator is required for specifying the IPsec configuration. For more information, see xref:../../networking/networking_operators/k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator.adoc#k8s-nmstate-about-the-k8s-nmstate-operator[Kubernetes NMState Operator].

--
[NOTE]
====
The NMState Operator is supported on {gcp-first} only for configuring IPsec.
====
--
* The Butane tool (`butane`) is installed. To install Butane, see xref:../../installing/install_config/installing-customizing.adoc#installation-special-config-butane-install_installing-customizing[Installing Butane].

These prerequisites are required to add certificates into the host NSS database and to configure IPsec to communicate with external hosts.

== IPsec encryption for pod-to-pod traffic

For IPsec encryption of pod-to-pod traffic, the following sections describe which specific pod-to-pod traffic is encrypted, what kind of encryption protocol is used, and how X.509 certificates are handled. These sections do not apply to IPsec encryption between the cluster and external hosts, which you must configure manually for your specific external network infrastructure.
