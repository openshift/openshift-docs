toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can expand the cluster network range after cluster installation. You might want to expand the cluster network range if you need more IP addresses for additional nodes.

For example, if you deployed a cluster and specified `10.128.0.0/19` as the cluster network range and a host prefix of `23`, you are limited to 16 nodes. You can expand that to 510 nodes by changing the CIDR mask on a cluster to `/14`.

When expanding the cluster network address range, your cluster must use the xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/about-ovn-kubernetes.adoc#about-ovn-kubernetes[OVN-Kubernetes network plugin]. Other network plugins are not supported.

The following limitations apply when modifying the cluster network IP address range:

- The CIDR mask size specified must always be smaller than the currently configured CIDR mask size, because you can only increase IP space by adding more nodes to an installed cluster
- The host prefix cannot be modified
- Pods that are configured with an overridden default gateway must be recreated after the cluster network expands
