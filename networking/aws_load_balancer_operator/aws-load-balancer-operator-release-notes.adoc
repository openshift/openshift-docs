[id="aws-load-balancer-operator-1.1.0-bug-fixes"]
=== Bug fixes

* A FIPS-compliant cluster must use TLS version 1.2. Previously, webhooks for the AWS Load Balancer Controller only accepted TLS 1.3 as the minimum version, resulting in an error such as the following on a FIPS-compliant cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
remote error: tls: protocol version not supported
----
+
Now, the AWS Load Balancer Controller accepts TLS 1.2 as the minimum TLS version, resolving this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-14846[*OCPBUGS-14846*])
