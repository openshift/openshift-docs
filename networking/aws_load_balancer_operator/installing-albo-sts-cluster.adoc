= Installing AWS Load Balancer Operator on a Security Token Service cluster

toc::[]

You can install the AWS Load Balancer (ALB) Operator on a Security Token Service (STS) cluster.

The ALB Operator relies on a `CredentialsRequest` to bootstrap the Operator and for the `AWSLoadBalancerController` instance. The ALB Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available.

== Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

An additional IAM role is required to successfully install the ALB Operator on a Security Token Service (STS) cluster. The IAM role is required to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The Operator generates a `CredentialsRequest` with this role to bootstrap itself.

There are two options for creating the IAM role:

* Using `ccoctl` and a predefined `CredentialsRequest`.
* Using the AWS CLI and predefined AWS manifests.

Use the AWS CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.
