= Installing AWS Load Balancer Operator on a Security Token Service cluster

toc::[]

You can install the AWS Load Balancer Operator on a Security Token Service (STS) cluster.

The AWS Load Balancer Operator relies on `CredentialsRequest` to bootstrap the Operator and for each `AWSLoadBalancerController` instance. The AWS Load Balancer Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available. The Cloud Credential Operator does not provision the secrets automatically in the STS cluster. You must set the credentials secrets manually by using the `ccoctl` binary.

If you do not want to provision credential secret by using the Cloud Credential Operator, you can configure the `AWSLoadBalancerController` instance on the STS cluster by specifying the credential secret in the AWS load Balancer Controller custom resource (CR).
