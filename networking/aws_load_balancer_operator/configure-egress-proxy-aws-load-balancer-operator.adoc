You can configure the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator. After configuring the cluster-wide proxy in the AWS Load Balancer Operator, Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically updates all the deployments of the Operators with the environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`. These variables are populated to the managed controller by the AWS Load Balancer Operator.
