toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) domain by using the CNI VRF plugin. The virtual network that this plugin creates is associated with the physical interface that you specify.

Using a secondary network with a VRF instance has the following advantages:

Workload isolation:: Isolate workload traffic by configuring a VRF instance for the additional network. 
Improved security:: Enable improved security through isolated network paths in the VRF domain.
Multi-tenancy support:: Support multi-tenancy through network segmentation with a unique routing table in the VRF domain for each tenant.

[NOTE]
====
Applications that use VRFs must bind to a specific device. The common usage is to use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option for a socket. The `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option binds the socket to the device that is specified in the passed interface name, for example, `eth1`. To use the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` option, the application must have `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities.

Using a VRF through the `ip vrf exec` command is not supported in {product-title} pods. To use VRF, bind applications directly to the VRF interface.
