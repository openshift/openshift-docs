You can use the following Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins for creating additional networks in your {product-title} cluster.

* *bridge*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-bridge-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a bridge-based additional network]
 to allow pods on the same host to communicate with each other and the host.

* *bond-cni*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-bond-cni-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a Bond CNI secondary network] to provide a method for aggregating multiple network interfaces into a single logical _bonded_ interface.

* *host-device*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-host-device-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a host-device additional network] to allow pods access to a physical Ethernet network device on the host system.

* *ipvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-ipvlan-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure an ipvlan-based additional network] to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts, similar to a macvlan-based additional network. Unlike a macvlan-based additional network, each pod shares the same MAC address as the parent physical network interface.

* *vlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-vlan-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a vlan-based additional network] to allow VLAN-based network isolation and connectivity for pods.

* *macvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-macvlan-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a macvlan-based additional network] to allow pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and pods on those hosts by using a physical network interface. Each pod that is attached to a macvlan-based additional network is provided a unique MAC address.

* *TAP*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-tap-object_configuring-additional-network[Configure a tap-based additional network] to create a tap device inside the container namespace. A tap device enables user space programs to send and receive network packets.

* *SR-IOV*: xref:../../networking/hardware_networks/about-sriov.adoc#about-sriov[Configure an SR-IOV based additional network] to allow pods to attach to a virtual function (VF) interface on SR-IOV capable hardware on the host system.

* *route-override*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-route-override-cni_configuring-additional-network[Configure a `route-override` based additional network] to allow pods to override and set routes.
