toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster using the macvlan Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in.
When a Pod is attached to the network, the plug-in creates a sub-interface from the parent interface on the host.
A unique hardware mac address is generated for each sub-device.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The unique MAC addresses this plug-in generates for sub-interfaces might not be
compatible with the security polices of your cloud provider.
====

You specify a basic configuration directly in YAML. This approach offers fewer configuration options than by specifying a macvlan configuration by using a CNI object directly in JSON.
