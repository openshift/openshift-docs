toc::[]

Administrators can use the `MultiNetworkPolicy` API to create multiple network policies that manage traffic for pods attached to secondary networks. For example, you can create policies that allow or deny traffic based on specific ports, IPs/ranges, or labels.

Multi-network policies can be used to manage traffic on secondary networks in the cluster. They cannot managed the cluster's default network or primary network of user-defined networks. 

As a cluster administrator, you can configure a multi-network policy for any of the following network types:

* Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
* MAC Virtual Local Area Network (MacVLAN)
* IP Virtual Local Area Network (IPVLAN)
* Bond Container Network Interface (CNI) over SR-IOV
* OVN-Kubernetes additional networks

[NOTE]
====
Support for configuring multi-network policies for SR-IOV additional networks is only supported with kernel network interface controllers (NICs). SR-IOV is not supported for Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) applications.
