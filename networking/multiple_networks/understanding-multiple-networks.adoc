In Kubernetes, container networking is delegated to networking plug-ins that
implement the Container Network Interface (CNI).

{product-title} uses the Multus CNI plug-in to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins.
During cluster installation, you configure your _default_ Pod network. The
default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can
define an _additional network_ based on the available CNI plug-ins and attach
one or more of these networks to your Pods. You can define more than one
additional network for your cluster, depending on your needs. This gives you
flexibility when you configure Pods that deliver network functionality, such as
switching or routing.

[id="additional-network-considerations"]
== Usage scenarios for an additional network

You can use an additional network in situations where network isolation is
needed, including data plane and control plane separation. Isolating network
traffic is useful for the following performance and security reasons:

Performance:: You can send traffic on two different planes in order to manage
how much traffic is along each plane.
Security:: You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed
specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that
must not be shared between tenants or customers.

All of the Pods in the cluster still use the cluster-wide default network
to maintain connectivity across the cluster. Every Pod has an `eth0` interface
that is attached to the cluster-wide Pod network. You can view the interfaces
for a Pod by using the `oc exec -it <pod_name> \-- ip a` command. If you
add additional network interfaces that use Multus CNI, they are named `net1`,
`net2`, ..., `netN`.

To attach additional network interfaces to a Pod, you must create configurations
that define how the interfaces are attached. You specify each interface by using
a Custom Resource (CR) that has a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` type. A CNI
configuration inside each of these CRs defines how that interface is created.

== Additional networks in {product-title}

{product-title} provides the following CNI plug-ins for creating additional
networks in your cluster:

 * *bridge*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-bridge.adoc#configuring-bridge[Creating a bridge-based additional network]
 allows Pods on the same host to communicate with each other and the host.

* *host-device*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-host-device.adoc#configuring-host-device[Creating a host-device additional network] allows Pods access to a physical Ethernet network device on the host system.

 * *macvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-macvlan.adoc#configuring-macvlan[Creating a macvlan-based additional network]
 allows Pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and Pods on those hosts
 by using a physical network interface. Each Pod that is attached to a macvlan-based
 additional network is provided a unique MAC address.

 * *ipvlan*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-ipvlan.adoc#configuring-ipvlan[Creating an ipvlan-based additional network]
 allows Pods on a host to communicate with other hosts and Pods on those hosts,
 similar to a macvlan-based additional network. Unlike a macvlan-based
 additional network, each Pod shares the same MAC address as the parent physical
 network interface.

 * *SR-IOV*: xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-sr-iov.adoc#configuring-sr-iov[Creating a SR-IOV based additional network]
 allows Pods to attach to a virtual function (VF) interface on SR-IOV capable
 hardware on the host system.
