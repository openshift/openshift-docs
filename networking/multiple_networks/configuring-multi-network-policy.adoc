toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure multi-network for additional networks. You can specify multi-network policy for SR-IOV, macvlan, and OVN-Kubernetes additional networks. Macvlan additional networks are fully supported. Other types of additional networks, such as ipvlan, are not supported.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Support for configuring multi-network policies for SR-IOV additional networks is a Technology Preview feature and is only supported with kernel network interface cards (NICs). SR-IOV is not supported for Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) applications.

For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/[Technology Preview Features Support Scope].

[NOTE]
====
Configured network policies are ignored in IPv6 networks.
