toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure a multi-network policy for a Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV), MAC Virtual Local Area Network (MacVLAN), or OVN-Kubernetes additional networks. MacVLAN additional networks are fully supported. Other types of additional networks, such as IP Virtual Local Area Network (IPVLAN), are not supported. 

[NOTE]
====
Support for configuring multi-network policies for SR-IOV additional networks is only supported with kernel network interface controllers (NICs). SR-IOV is not supported for Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) applications.
