Before the implementation of user-defined networks (UDN), the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin for {product-title} only supported a Layer 3 topology on the primary or _main_ network. Due to Kubernetes design principles: all pods are attached to the main network, all pods communicate with each other by their IP addresses, and inter-pod traffic is restricted according to network policy.

While the Kubernetes design is useful for simple deployments, this Layer 3 topology restricts customization of primary network segment configurations, especially for modern multi-tenant deployments.

UDN improves the flexibility and segmentation capabilities of the default Layer 3 topology for a Kubernetes pod network by enabling custom Layer 2, Layer 3, and localnet network segments, where all these segments are isolated by default. These segments act as either primary or secondary networks for container pods and virtual machines that use the default OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. UDNs enable a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance.

[NOTE]
====
Nodes that use `cgroupv1` Linux Control Groups (cgroup) must be reconfigured from `cgroupv1` to `cgroupv2` before creating a user-defined network. For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-cluster-cgroups-2[Configuring Linux cgroup].

A cluster administrator can use a UDN to create and define additional networks that span multiple namespaces at the cluster level by leveraging the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR). Additionally, a cluster administrator or a cluster user can use a UDN to define additional networks at the namespace level with the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.

The following sections further emphasize the benefits and limitations of user-defined networks, the best practices when creating a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` or `UserDefinedNetwork` CR, how to create the CR, and additional configuration details that might be relevant to your deployment.
