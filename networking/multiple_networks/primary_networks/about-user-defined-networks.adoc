Before the implementation of user-defined networks (UDNs) in the default the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin for {product-title}, the Kubernetes Layer 3 topology was supported as the primary network, or _main_ network, to where all pods attach. The Kubernetes design principle requires that all pods communicate with each other by their IP addresses, and Kubernetes restricts inter-pod traffic according to the Kubernetes network policy. While the Kubernetes design is useful for simple deployments, the Layer 3 topology restricts customization of primary network segment configurations, especially for modern multi-tenant deployments.

UDN improves the flexibility and segmentation capabilities of the default Layer 3 topology for a Kubernetes pod network by enabling custom Layer 2, Layer 3, and localnet network segments, where all these segments are isolated by default. These segments act as either primary or secondary networks for container pods and virtual machines that use the default OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin. UDNs enable a wide range of network architectures and topologies, enhancing network flexibility, security, and performance. You can build a UDN by using a Virtual Router Function (VRF).

The following diagram shows four cluster namespaces, where each namespace has a single assigned UDN, and each UDN has an assigned custom subnet for its pod IP allocations. The OVN-Kubernetes handles any overlapping UDN subnets. Without using the Kubernetes network policy, a pod attached to a UDN can communicate with other pods in that UDN. By default, these pods are isolated from communicating with pods that exist in other UDNs. For microsegmentation, you can apply the Kubernetes network policy within a UDN. You can assign one or more UDNs to a namespace, with a limitation of only one primary UDN to a namespace, and one or more namespaces to a UDN.

[NOTE]
====
Nodes that use `cgroupv1` Linux Control Groups (cgroup) must be reconfigured from `cgroupv1` to `cgroupv2` before creating a user-defined network. For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-cgroups-2.adoc#nodes-cluster-cgroups-2[Configuring Linux cgroup].

A cluster administrator can use a user-defined network to create and define additional networks that span multiple namespaces at the cluster level by leveraging the `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` custom resource (CR). Additionally, a cluster administrator or a cluster user can use a user-defined network to define additional networks at the namespace level with the `UserDefinedNetwork` CR.

The following diagram shows tenant isolation that a cluster administrator created by defining a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` CR for each tenant. This network configuration allows a network to span across many namespaces. In the diagram, the `udn-1` disconnected network selects `namespace-1` and `namespace-2`, while the `udn-2` disconnected network selects `namespace-3` and `namespace-4`. A tenant acts as a disconnected network that is isolated from other tenants' networks. Pods from a namespace can communicate with pods in another namespace only if those namespaces exist in the same tenant network.

The following sections further emphasize the benefits and limitations of user-defined networks, the best practices when creating a `ClusterUserDefinedNetwork` or `UserDefinedNetwork` CR, how to create the CR, and additional configuration details that might be relevant to your deployment.
