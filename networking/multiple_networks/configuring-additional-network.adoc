As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster. The following network types are supported:

* xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-bridge-object_configuring-additional-network[Bridge]
* xref:../../networking/multiple_networks/configuring-additional-network.adoc#nw-multus-host-device-object_configuring-additional-network[Host device]

[id="{context}_approaches-managing-additional-network"]
== Approaches to managing an additional network

You can manage the life cycle of an additional network by two approaches. Each approach is mutually exclusive and you can only use one approach for managing an additional network at a time. For either approach, the additional network is managed by a Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that you configure.

For an additional network, IP addresses are provisioned through an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plug-in that you configure as part of the additional network. The IPAM plug-in supports a variety of IP address assignment approaches including DHCP and static assignment.

* Modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration: The CNO automatically creates and manages the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. In addition to managing the object lifecycle the CNO ensures a DHCP is available for an additional network that uses a DHCP assigned IP address.

* Applying a YAML manifest: You can manage the additional network directly by creating an `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. This approach allows for the chaining of CNI plug-ins.

== Configuration for an additional network attachment

An additional network is configured via the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API in the `k8s.cni.cncf.io` API group. The configuration for the API is described in the following table:

.`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API fields
[cols=".^3,.^2,.^5",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|The name for the additional network.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|The namespace that the object is associated with.

|`spec.config`
|`string`
|The CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format.

=== Configuration of an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator

The configuration for an additional network attachment is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration.

The following YAML describes the configuration parameters for managing an additional network with the CNO:

.Cluster Network Operator configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  # ...
  additionalNetworks: <1>
  - name: <name> <2>
    namespace: <namespace> <3>
    rawCNIConfig: |- <4>
      {
        ...
      }
    type: Raw
----
<1> An array of one or more additional network configurations.

<2> The name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating. The name must be unique within the specified `namespace`.

<3> The namespace to create the network attachment in. If
you do not specify a value, then the `default` namespace is used.

<4> A CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format.

[id="{context}_configuration-additional-network-yaml"]
=== Configuration of an additional network from a YAML manifest

The configuration for an additional network is specified from a YAML configuration file, such as in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: <name> <1>
spec:
  config: |- <2>
    {
      ...
    }
----
<1> The name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating.
<2> A CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format.
