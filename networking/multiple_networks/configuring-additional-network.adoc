As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster. The following network types are supported:

== Approaches to managing an additional network

You can manage the lifecycle of an additional network by choosing one of the two available approaches. Each approach is mutually exclusive and you can only use one approach for managing an additional network at a time. For either approach, the additional network is managed by a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin that you configure.

* Modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration: The CNO automatically creates and manages the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` custom resource definition (CRD). In addition to managing an object lifecycle the CNO ensures a DHCP is available for an additional network that uses a DHCP-assigned IP address.

* Applying a YAML manifest: You can manage the additional network directly by creating a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD. This approach allows for the chaining of CNI plugins.

For an additional network, IP addresses are provisioned through an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin that you configure as part of the additional network. The IPAM plugin supports a variety of IP address assignment approaches including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and static assignment.

[NOTE]
====
When deploying {product-title} nodes with multiple network interfaces on {rh-openstack-first} with OVN Kubernetes, DNS configuration of the additional interface might take precedence over the DNS configuration of the primary interface. In this case, remove the DNS nameservers for the subnet ID that is attached to the additional interface:

[source,terminal]
----
$ openstack subnet set --dns-nameserver 0.0.0.0 <subnet_id>

[id="ip-address-assignment-for-additional-networks_{context}"]
== IP address assignment for additional networks

For additional networks, IP addresses can be assigned using an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin, which supports various assignment methods, including Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and static assignment.

The DHCP IPAM CNI plugin responsible for dynamic assignment of IP addresses operates with two distinct components:

* *CNI Plugin*: Responsible for integrating with the Kubernetes networking stack to request and release IP addresses.
* *DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon*: A listener for DHCP events that coordinates with existing DHCP servers in the environment to handle IP address assignment requests. This daemon is _not_ a DHCP server itself.

For networks requiring `type: dhcp` in their IPAM configuration, ensure the following:

* A DHCP server is available and running in the environment. The DHCP server is external to the cluster and is expected to be part of the customer's existing network infrastructure.
* The DHCP server is appropriately configured to serve IP addresses to the nodes.

In cases where a DHCP server is unavailable in the environment, it is recommended to use the Whereabouts IPAM CNI plugin instead. The Whereabouts CNI provides similar IP address management capabilities without the need for an external DHCP server.

[NOTE]
====
Use the Whereabouts CNI plugin when there is no external DHCP server or where static IP address management is preferred. The Whereabouts plugin includes a reconciler daemon to manage stale IP address allocations.
====

A DHCP lease must be periodically renewed throughout the container's lifetime, so a separate daemon, the DHCP IPAM CNI Daemon, is required. To deploy the DHCP IPAM CNI daemon, modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration to trigger the deployment of this daemon as part of the additional network setup.

[id="configuration-additional-network-attachment_{context}"]
== Configuration for an additional network attachment

An additional network is configured by using the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API in the `k8s.cni.cncf.io` API group.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not store any sensitive information or a secret in the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` CRD because this information is accessible by the project administration user.
====

The configuration for the API is described in the following table:

.`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API fields
[cols=".^3,.^2,.^5",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|The name for the additional network.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|The namespace that the object is associated with.

|`spec.config`
|`string`
|The CNI plugin configuration in JSON format.

=== Configuration of an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator

The configuration for an additional network attachment is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration.

The following YAML describes the configuration parameters for managing an additional network with the CNO:

.Cluster Network Operator configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  # ...
  additionalNetworks: <1>
  - name: <name> <2>
    namespace: <namespace> <3>
    rawCNIConfig: |- <4>
      {
        ...
      }
    type: Raw
----
<1> An array of one or more additional network configurations.
<2> The name for the additional network attachment that you are creating. The name must be unique within the specified `namespace`.
<3> The namespace to create the network attachment in. If you do not specify a value then the `default` namespace is used.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
To prevent namespace issues for the OVN-Kubernetes network plugin, do not name your additional network attachment `default`, because this namespace is reserved for the `default` additional network attachment.
====
<4> A CNI plugin configuration in JSON format.

[id="configuration-additional-network-yaml_{context}"]
=== Configuration of an additional network from a YAML manifest

The configuration for an additional network is specified from a YAML configuration file, such as in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1
kind: NetworkAttachmentDefinition
metadata:
  name: <name> <1>
spec:
  config: |- <2>
    {
      ...
    }
----
<1> The name for the additional network attachment that you are creating.
<2> A CNI plugin configuration in JSON format.
