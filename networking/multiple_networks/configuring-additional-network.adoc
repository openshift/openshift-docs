toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster. The following additional network types are supported:

* macvlan
* ipvlan
* bridge
* host-device

== Approaches to managing an additional network

You can manage the life cycle of an additional network by two mutually exclusively approaches. For either approach, the additional network is managed by a Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in that you configure.

Modify the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration::
+
--
The CNO automatically creates and manages the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. In addition to managing the object lifecycle the CNO ensures a DHCP is available for an additional network that uses a DHCP assigned IP address.
--

Applying a YAML manifest::
You can manage the additional network directly by creating an `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object. This approach allows for the chaining of CNI plug-ins.

== Configuration for an additional network attachment

An additional network is configured through the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API in the `k8s.cni.cncf.io` API group. The configuration for the API is described in the following table:

.`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` API fields
[cols=".^3,.^2,.^5",options="header"]
|====
|Field|Type|Description

|`metadata.name`
|`string`
|The name for the additional network.

|`metadata.namespace`
|`string`
|The namespace that the object is associated with.

|`spec.config`
|`string`
|The CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format.

|====

=== Configure an additional network through the Cluster Network Operator

The configuration for an additional network attachment is specified as part of the Cluster Network Operator (CNO) configuration.

The following YAML describes the configuration parameters for managing an additional network with the CNO:

.Cluster Network Operator configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network
metadata:
  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: <1>
  - name: <name> <2>
    namespace: <namespace> <3>
    rawCNIConfig: |- <4>
      {
        ...
      }
    type: Raw
----
<1> An array of one or more additional network configurations.

<2> The name for the additional network attachment that you are
creating. The name must be unique within the specified `namespace`.

<3> The namespace to create the network attachment in. If
you do not specify a value, then the `default` namespace is used.

<4> A CNI plug-in configuration in JSON format.

=== Configure an additional network from a YAML manifest

This works as you'd expect. `oc create`.

== Configuration for additional network types

The specific configuration fields for additional networks is described in the following sections.

include::modules/nw-multus-bridge-object.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
include::modules/nw-multus-host-device-object.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
include::modules/nw-multus-ipvlan-object.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
include::modules/nw-multus-macvlan-object.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

== IP address assignment

= Creating an additional network attachment with the Cluster Network Operator

The Cluster Network Operator (CNO) manages additional network definitions. When
you specify an additional network to create, the CNO creates the
`NetworkAttachmentDefinition` object automatically.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not edit the `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` objects that the Cluster Network
Operator manages. Doing so might disrupt network traffic on your additional
network.
====

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. To edit the CNO configuration, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit networks.operator.openshift.io cluster
----

. Modify the CR that you are creating by adding the configuration for the
additional network you are creating, as in the following example CR.
+
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: operator.openshift.io/v1
kind: Network

  name: cluster
spec:
  additionalNetworks: <1>

    namespace: test-1

    rawCNIConfig: |-
      {
        "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
        "name": "test-network-1",

            }
          ]
        }
      }

.Verification

* Confirm that the CNO created the NetworkAttachmentDefinition object by running the following command. There might be a delay before the CNO creates the object.
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get network-attachment-definitions -n <namespace>
----
+
--
where:

`<namespace>`:: Specifies the namespace for the network attachment.

= Creating an additional network attachment by applying a YAML manifest

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file with your additional network configuration.

. To create the additional network, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
