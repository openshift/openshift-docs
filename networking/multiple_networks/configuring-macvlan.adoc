As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your cluster using the macvlan Container Network Interface (CNI) plug-in with advanced customization.
When a pod is attached to the network, the plug-in creates a sub-interface from the parent interface on the host.
A unique hardware mac address is generated for each sub-device.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The unique MAC addresses this plug-in generates for sub-interfaces might not be
compatible with the security polices of your cloud provider.
====

You specify a configuration with a CNI object. This approach allows you to specify additional configuration options that are not available when using a YAML configuration.
