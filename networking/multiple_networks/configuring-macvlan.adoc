As a cluster administrator, you can configure an additional network for your
cluster using the macvlan CNI plug-in. When a Pod is attached to the network,
the plug-in creates a sub-interface from the parent interface on the host. A
unique hardware mac address is generated for each sub-device.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The unique MAC addresses this plug-in generates for sub-interfaces might not be
compatible with the security polices of your cloud provider.
