toc::[]

During cluster installation, you can configure the node port range to meet the requirements of your cluster. After cluster installation, only a cluster administrator can expand the range as a postinstallation task. If your cluster uses a large number of node ports, consider increasing the available port range according to the requirements of your cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before you expand a node port range, consider that Red{nbsp}Hat has not performed testing outside the default port range of `30000-32768`. For ranges outside the default port range, ensure that you test to verify the expanding node port range does not impact your cluster. If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, create a new cluster and set the required range for it. 
====

If you do not set a node port range during cluster installation, the default range of `30000-32768` applies to your cluster. In this situation, you can expand the range on either side, but you must preserve `30000-32768` within your new port range.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you expand the node port range and {oc-first} stops working because of a port conflict with the OpenShift API server, you must create a new cluster.
Ensure that the new node port range does not overlap with any ports already in use by host processes or pods that are configured with host networking.
