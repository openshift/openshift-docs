As a cluster administrator, you can deploy containerized eBPF applications with the eBPF Manager Operator.

For the example eBPF program deployed in this procedure, the sample manifest does the following:

First, it creates basic Kubernetes objects like `Namespace`, `ServiceAccount`, and `ClusterRoleBinding`. It also creates a `XdpProgram` object, which is a custom resource definition (CRD) that eBPF Manager provides, that loads the eBPF XDP program. Each program type has it's own CRD, but they are similar in what they do. For more information, see link:https://bpfman.io/main/getting-started/example-bpf-k8s/#loading-ebpf-programs-on-kubernetes[Loading eBPF Programs On Kubernetes].

Second, it creates a daemon set which runs a user space program that reads the eBPF maps that the eBPF program is populating. This eBPF map is volume mounted using a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver. By volume mounting the eBPF map in the container in lieu of accessing it on the host, the application pod can access the eBPF maps without being privileged. For more information on how the CSI is configured, see See link:https://bpfman.io/main/getting-started/example-bpf-k8s/#deploying-an-ebpf-enabled-application-on-kubernetes[Deploying an eBPF enabled application On Kubernetes].
