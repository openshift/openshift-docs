=== Bug fixes

Previously, the ExternalDNS Operator could not deploy operands on HCP clusters. With this release, the Operator deploys operands in a running and ready state. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-37059[*OCPBUGS-37059*])

Previously, the ExternalDNS Operator was not using RHEL 9 as its building or base images. With this release, RHEL9 is the base. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-41683[*OCPBUGS-41683*])

Previously, the godoc had a broken link for Infoblox provider. With this release, the godoc is revised for accuracy. Some links are removed while some other are replaced with GitHub permalinks. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-36797[*OCPBUGS-36797*])
