toc::[]

The AWS Load Balancer Operator is an Operator supported by Red{nbsp}Hat that users can optionally install on SRE-managed {product-title} (ROSA) clusters. The AWS Load Balancer Operator manages the lifecycle of the AWS Load Balancer Controller that provisions AWS Elastic Load Balancing v2 (ELBv2) services for applications running in ROSA clusters.

[TIP]
====
Load Balancers created by the AWS Load Balancer Operator cannot be used for xref:../../networking/routes/route-configuration.adoc#route-configuration[OpenShift Routes], and should only be used for individual services or ingress resources that do not need the full layer 7 capabilities of an OpenShift Route.

The link:https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/[AWS Load Balancer Controller] manages AWS Elastic Load Balancers for a {product-title} (ROSA) cluster. The controller provisions link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB)] when you create Kubernetes Ingress resources and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html[AWS Network Load Balancers (NLB)] when implementing Kubernetes Service resources with a type of LoadBalancer.

Compared with the default AWS in-tree load balancer provider, this controller is developed with advanced annotations for both ALBs and NLBs. Some advanced use cases are:

* Using native Kubernetes Ingress objects with ALBs
* Integrate ALBs with the AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) service
* Specify custom NLB source IP ranges
* Specify custom NLB internal IP addresses

The link:https://github.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator[AWS Load Balancer Operator] is used to used to install, manage and configure an instance of `aws-load-balancer-controller` in a ROSA cluster.
