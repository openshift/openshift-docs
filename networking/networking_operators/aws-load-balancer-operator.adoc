====
Load Balancers created by the AWS Load Balancer Operator cannot be used for xref:../../networking/ingress_load_balancing/routes/creating-basic-routes.adoc#creating-basic-routes[OpenShift Routes], and should only be used for individual services or ingress resources that do not need the full layer 7 capabilities of an OpenShift Route.
