The AWS Load Balancer Operator is an Operator supported by Red{nbsp}Hat that users can optionally install on SRE-managed {product-title} clusters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Load Balancers created by the AWS Load Balancer Operator cannot be used for xref:../../networking/ingress_load_balancing/routes/route-configuration.adoc#route-configuration[OpenShift Routes], and should only be used for individual services or ingress resources that do not need the full layer 7 capabilities of an OpenShift Route.
====

The link:https://github.com/openshift/aws-load-balancer-operator[AWS Load Balancer Operator] is used to install, manage and configure the link:https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/[AWS Load Balancer Controller] in a ROSA cluster.

The AWS Load Balancer Controller provisions link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html[AWS Application Load Balancers (ALB)] when you create Kubernetes Ingress resources and link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html[AWS Network Load Balancers (NLB)] when you create a Kubernetes Service resource with a type of LoadBalancer.

Compared with the default AWS in-tree load balancer provider, this controller is developed with advanced annotations for both ALBs and NLBs. Some advanced use cases are:

* Using native Kubernetes Ingress objects with ALBs
* Integrate ALBs with the AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) service
* Specify custom NLB source IP ranges
* Specify custom NLB internal IP addresses
