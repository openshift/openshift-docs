= Preparing an AWS STS cluster for the AWS Load Balancer Operator
:context: albo-sts-cluster

toc::[]

You can install the {aws-first} Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses the {sts-first}. Follow these steps to prepare your cluster before installing the Operator.

The {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator relies on the `CredentialsRequest` object to bootstrap the Operator and the {aws-short} Load Balancer Controller. The {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator waits until the required secrets are created and available.

[id="{context}_prerequisites"]
== Prerequisites

* You installed the {oc-first}.

* You know the infrastructure ID of your cluster. To show this ID, run the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath="{.status.infrastructureName}" 
----

* You know the OpenID Connect (OIDC) DNS information for your cluster. To show this information, enter the following command in your CLI:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get authentication.config cluster -o=jsonpath="{.spec.serviceAccountIssuer}" <1>
----
<1> An OIDC DNS example is `\https://rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/28292va7ad7mr9r4he1fb09b14t59t4f`.

* You logged into the {aws-short} Web Console, navigated to *IAM* -> *Access management* -> *Identity providers*, and located the OIDC Amazon Resource Name (ARN) information. An OIDC ARN example is `arn:aws:iam::777777777777:oidc-provider/<oidc_dns_url>`.

== Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Operator

An additional {aws-first} Identity and Access Management (IAM) role is required to successfully install the {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator on a cluster that uses {sts-short}. The IAM role is required to interact with subnets and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The {aws-short} Load Balancer Operator generates the `CredentialsRequest` object with the IAM role to bootstrap itself.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-configuring_installing-aws-customizations[the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`)] and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the {aws-short} CLI and predefined {aws-short} manifests.

Use the {aws-short} CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.

== Creating an IAM role for the AWS Load Balancer Controller

The `CredentialsRequest` object for the {aws-short} Load Balancer Controller must be set with a manually provisioned IAM role.

You can create the IAM role by using the following options:

* Using xref:../../../installing/installing_aws/ipi/installing-aws-customizations.adoc#cco-ccoctl-configuring_installing-aws-customizations[the Cloud Credential Operator utility (`ccoctl`)] and a predefined `CredentialsRequest` object.
* Using the {aws-short} CLI and predefined {aws-short} manifests.

Use the {aws-short} CLI if your environment does not support the `ccoctl` command.
