Kubernetes ensures that pods are able to network with each other, and allocates
each pod an IP address from an internal network. This ensures all containers
within the pod behave as if they were on the same host. Giving each pod its own
IP address means that pods can be treated like physical hosts or virtual
machines in terms of port allocation, networking, naming, service discovery,
load balancing, application configuration, and migration.

[NOTE]
====
Some cloud platforms offer metadata APIs that listen on the 169.254.169.254 IP address, a link-local IP address in the IPv4 `169.254.0.0/16` CIDR block.

This CIDR block is not reachable from the pod network. Pods that need access to these IP addresses must be given host network access by setting the `spec.hostNetwork` field in the pod spec to `true`.

If you allow a pod host network access, you grant the pod privileged access to the underlying network infrastructure.
