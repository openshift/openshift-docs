This feature provides native Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing capabilities for the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using the MetalLB Operator and there are existing `FRRConfiguration` CRs in the `metallb-system` namespace created by cluster administrators or third-party cluster components other than the MetalLB Operator, you must ensure that they are copied to the `openshift-frr-k8s` namespace or that those third-party cluster components use the new namespace. For more information, see xref:../../../networking/advanced_networking/bgp_routing/migrating-frr-k8s-resources.adoc#migrating-frr-k8s-resources[Migrating FRR-K8s resources].
