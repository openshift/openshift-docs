[role="_abstract"]
The Network bonding method, also known as _link aggregration_ or _network interface controller (NIC) teaming_, combines many network interfaces into a single, logical interface. Network bonding uses different modes to handle how network traffic distributes across bonded interfaces. Each mode provides either load balancing and fault tolerance capabilities to your network. Red Hat supports Open vSwitch (OVS) bonding and kernel bonding.
