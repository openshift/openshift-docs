[role="_abstract"]
Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is used to synchronize clocks in a network. When used in conjunction with hardware support, PTP is capable of sub-microsecond accuracy, and is more accurate than Network Time Protocol (NTP).

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your `openshift-sdn` cluster with PTP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for hardware time stamping and you migrate to the OVN-Kubernetes plugin, the hardware time stamping cannot be applied to primary interface devices, such as an Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge. As a result, UDP version 4 configurations cannot work with a `br-ex` interface.
====

You can configure `linuxptp` services and use PTP-capable hardware in {product-title} cluster nodes.

Use the {product-title} web console or OpenShift CLI (`oc`) to install PTP by deploying the PTP Operator. The PTP Operator creates and manages the `linuxptp` services and provides the following features:

* Discovery of the PTP-capable devices in the cluster.

* Management of the configuration of `linuxptp` services.

* Notification of PTP clock events that negatively affect the performance and reliability of your application with the PTP Operator `cloud-event-proxy` sidecar.

[NOTE]
====
The PTP Operator works with PTP-capable devices on clusters provisioned only on bare-metal infrastructure.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although PTP provides superior accuracy over NTP, you can configure NTP as a backup time source for PTP Grandmaster (T-GM) clocks. In GNSS-to-NTP failover configurations, the system uses GNSS as the primary time source through PTP, but automatically fails over to NTP (`chronyd`) if the GNSS signal is lost or degraded. This provides resilient timekeeping even when the primary GNSS time source is temporarily unavailable. For more information about configuring GNSS-to-NTP failover, see _Configuring GNSS/NTP failover_.
