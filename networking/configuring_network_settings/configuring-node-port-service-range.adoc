toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
To meet your cluster node port requirements in {product-title}, you can configure the node port service range during installation or expand it after installation. You can expand the default range of `30000-32768` on either side while preserving this default range within your new configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat has not performed testing outside the default port range of `30000-32768`. For ranges outside the default port range, ensure that you test to verify the expanding node port range does not impact your cluster. In particular, ensure that there is:

- No overlap with any ports already in use by host processes
- No overlap with any ports already in use by pods that are configured with host networking

If you expanded the range and a port allocation issue occurs, create a new cluster and set the required range for it.

If you expand the node port range and {oc-first} stops working because of a port conflict with the {product-title} API server, you must create a new cluster.
