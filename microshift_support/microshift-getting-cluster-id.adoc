toc::[]

When providing information to Red{nbsp}Hat Support, it is helpful to provide the unique identifier of your cluster. For {microshift-short}, you can get your cluster ID manually by using the {oc-first} or by retrieving the ID from a file.

[NOTE]
====
A cluster ID is created only after the {microshift-short} service runs for the first time after installation.
