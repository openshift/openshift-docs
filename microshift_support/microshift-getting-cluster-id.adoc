toc::[]

When opening a support case, you can give information about your cluster to Red Hat Support by providing the unique identifier (UID) of your cluster. To uniquely identify a {microshift-short} cluster, use the `kube-system` namespace metadata UID.

[NOTE]
====
The cluster ID for a cluster gets created only after the {microshift-short} service runs for the first time after its installation.
