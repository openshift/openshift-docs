{product-title} etcd is delivered as part of the {product-title} RPM and runs as a separate process. The logs will appear in their own system log stream `journalctl -u microshift-etcd.scope`.

{product-title} manages the etcd process automatically. You will be able to view etcd running under systemd `systemctl status microshift-etcd` and collect logs from it.
