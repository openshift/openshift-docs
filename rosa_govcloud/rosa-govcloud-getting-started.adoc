Federal and government agencies can be granted access to the {product-title} in AWS GovCloud environment without further verification. However, commercial organizations and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) R&D Universities must provide documentation to show that they are supporting a government contract or in the process of bidding on a government contract such as a request for proposal (RFP), request for information (RFI), pre-bid stage. The customers who are in the government support verification process can review a subset of the FedRAMP Authority to Operate (ATO) documentation, but cannot gain access to the {product-title} in AWS GovCloud environment until verification is complete.
