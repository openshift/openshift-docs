//Federal and government agencies can be granted access to the {product-title} in AWS GovCloud environment without further verification. However, commercial organizations and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) R&D Universities must provide documentation to show that they are supporting a government contract or in the process of bidding on a government contract such as a request for proposal (RFP) or request for information (RFI) pre-bid stage. The customers who are in the government support verification process can review a subset of the FedRAMP Authority to Operate (ATO) documentation, but cannot gain access to the {product-title} in AWS GovCloud environment until verification is complete.

This service is for use by federal and government agencies, or by commercial organizations and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) R&D Universities supporting a government contract or in the process of bidding on a government contract such as a request for proposal (RFP) or request for information (RFI) pre-bid stage.
