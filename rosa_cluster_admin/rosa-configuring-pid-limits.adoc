// This assembly covers how to configure cluster-wide PID limits by configuring
// the kubeletconfig. Eventually, additional cluster-wide parameters should be
// available for configuration. As additional parameters are added, it might be 
// better to change this assembly to be "Configuring cluster parameters" or 
// something similar.
//
// Also, this content theoretically applies to OSD as well, but the PID limits
// can only be configured through the ROSA CLI. When other methods are added for
// configuring PID limits, this assembly and its modules can be evaluated for 
// inclusion in the OSD docs.

A process identifier (PID) is a unique identifier assigned by the Linux kernel to each process or thread currently running on a system. The number of processes that can run simultaneously on a system is limited to 4,194,304 by the Linux kernel. This number might also be affected by limited access to other system resources such as memory, CPU, and disk space.

In {product-title} 4.11 and later, by default, a pod can have a maximum of 4,096 PIDs. If your workload requires more than that, you can increase the allowed maximum number of PIDs by configuring a `KubeletConfig` object.

{product-title} clusters running versions earlier than 4.11 use a default PID limit of `1024`.
