== What to expect from cluster notifications

As a cluster administrator, you need to be aware of when and why cluster notifications are sent, as well as their types and severity levels, in order to effectively understand the health and administration needs of your cluster.

[id="cluster-notification-emails_{context}"]
== Cluster notification emails

By default, when a cluster notification is sent to the cluster, it is also sent as an email to the cluster owner. You can configure additional recipients for notification emails to ensure that all appropriate users remain informed about the state of the cluster.

//TODO OSDOCS-8938: This doesn't actually work as intended as far as Laura can tell; OpenShift users can't unsubscribe from all types using this method - need to check in with Abhishek about this.

== Troubleshooting

.If you are not receiving cluster notification emails
* Ensure that emails sent from `@redhat.com` addresses are not filtered out of your email inbox.
* Ensure that your correct email address is listed as a notification contact for the cluster.
* Ask the cluster owner or administrator to add you as a notification contact: xref:#cluster-notification-emails_rosa-cluster-notifications[Cluster notification emails].

.If your cluster does not receive notifications
* Ensure that your cluster can access resources at `api.openshift.com`.
// Include this xref once all of the files have been added to the ROSA HCP distro.

* Ensure that your firewall is configured according to the documented prerequisites: xref:../rosa_planning/rosa-sts-aws-prereqs.adoc#osd-aws-privatelink-firewall-prerequisites_rosa-sts-aws-prereqs[AWS firewall prerequisites]
