= Configuring cluster memory to meet container memory and risk requirements
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

As a cluster administrator, you can help your clusters operate efficiently through managing application memory by:

* Determining the memory and risk requirements of a containerized application component and configuring the container memory parameters to suit those requirements.

* Configuring containerized application runtimes (for example, OpenJDK) to adhere optimally to the configured container memory parameters.

* Diagnosing and resolving memory-related error conditions associated with running in a container.

// The following include statements pull in the module files that comprise
// the assembly. Include any combination of concept, procedure, or reference
// modules required to cover the user story. You can also include other
// assemblies.
