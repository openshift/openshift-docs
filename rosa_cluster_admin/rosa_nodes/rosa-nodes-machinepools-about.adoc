{product-title} uses machine pools as an elastic, dynamic provisioning method on top of your cloud infrastructure.

The primary resources are machines, compute machine sets, and machine pools.

include::snippets/pid-limits.adoc[]

== Machines
A machine is a fundamental unit that describes the host for a worker node.

== Machine sets
`MachineSet` resources are groups of compute machines. If you need more machines or must scale them down, change the number of replicas in the machine pool to which the compute machine sets belong.

ifdef::openshift-rosa[]
Machine sets are not directly modifiable in ROSA.
endif::[]

== Machine pools
Machine pools are a higher level construct to compute machine sets.

A machine pool creates compute machine sets that are all clones of the same configuration across availability zones. Machine pools perform all of the host node provisioning management actions on a worker node. If you need more machines or must scale them down, change the number of replicas in the machine pool to meet your compute needs. You can manually configure scaling or set autoscaling.

By default, a cluster has one machine pool. During cluster installation, you can define instance type or size and add labels to this machine pool.

After a cluster's installation:

* You can remove or add labels to any machine pool.
* You can add additional machine pools to an existing cluster.
* You can add taints to any machine pool as long as there is one machine pool without any taints.
* You can create or delete a machine pool as long as there is one machine pool without any taints and at least two replicas for a Single-AZ cluster or three replicas for a Multi-AZ cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot change the machine pool node type or size. The machine pool node type or size is specified during their creation only. If you need a different node type or size, you must re-create a machine pool and specify the required node type or size values.
====
* You can add a label to each added machine pool.

Multiple machine pools can exist on a single cluster, and each machine pool can contain a unique node type and node size configuration.

== Machine pools in multiple zone clusters
In a cluster created across multiple Availability Zones (AZ), the machine pools can be created across either all of the three AZs or any single AZ of your choice. The machine pool created by default at the time of cluster creation will be created with machines in all three AZs and scale in multiples of three.


If you create a new Multi-AZ cluster, the machine pools are replicated to those zones automatically. By default, if you add a machine pool to an existing Multi-AZ cluster, the new machine pool is automatically created in all of the zones.

[NOTE]
====
You can override this default setting and create a machine pool in a Single-AZ of your choice.
====

Similarly, deleting a machine pool will delete it from all zones.
Due to this multiplicative effect, using machine pools in Multi-AZ cluster can consume more of your project's quota for a specific region when creating machine pools.
