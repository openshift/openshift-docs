{microshift-short} enables dynamic storage provisioning that is ready for immediate use with the logical volume manager storage (LVMS) Container Storage Interface (CSI) provider. The LVMS plugin is the Red Hat downstream version of TopoLVM, a CSI plugin for managing logical volume management (LVM) logical volumes (LVs) for Kubernetes.

LVMS provisions new LVM logical volumes for container workloads with appropriately configured persistent volume claims (PVCs). Each PVC references a storage class that represents an LVM Volume Group (VG) on the host node. LVs are only provisioned for scheduled pods.
