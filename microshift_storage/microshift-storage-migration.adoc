toc::[]

Storage version migration is used to update existing objects in the cluster from their current version to the latest version. The Kube Storage Version Migrator embedded controller is used in {microshift-short} to migrate resources without having to recreate those resources. Either you or a controller can create a `StorageVersionMigration` custom resource (CR) that will request a migration through the Migrator Controller.
