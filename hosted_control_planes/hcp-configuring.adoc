To get started with hosted control planes for {product-title}, you first configure your hosted cluster on the provider that you want to use. Then, you complete a few management tasks. 

You can view the procedures by selecting from one of the following providers:

[id="hcp-configuring-aws"]
== Amazon Web Services (AWS)

* xref:../networking/hardware_networks/configuring-sriov-operator.adoc#sriov-operator-hosted-control-planes_configuring-sriov-operator[Deploying the SR-IOV Operator for hosted control planes]: After you configure and deploy your hosting service cluster, you can create a subscription to the Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Operator on a hosted cluster. The SR-IOV pod runs on worker machines rather than the control plane.
* xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#node-tuning-hosted-cluster_node-tuning-operator[Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster]: To set node-level tuning on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In hosted control planes, you can configure node tuning by creating config maps that contain `Tuned` objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.
* xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#advanced-node-tuning-hosted-cluster_node-tuning-operator[Advanced node tuning for hosted clusters by setting kernel boot parameters]: More advanced tuning in hosted control planes requires setting kernel boot parameters.

== Bare metal

** Configure DNS
** Create an `InfraEnv` resource and add agents to it

** Scale the `NodePool` object for a hosted cluster
** Handle Ingress for a hosted cluster
** Enable node auto-scaling for a hosted cluster
** Destroy a hosted cluster
