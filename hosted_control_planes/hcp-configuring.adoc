toc::[]

To get started with hosted control planes for {product-title}, you first configure your hosted cluster on the provider that you want to use. Then, you complete a few management tasks.

The SR-IOV pod runs on worker machines rather than the control plane.
* xref:../scalability_and_performance/using-node-tuning-operator.adoc#node-tuning-hosted-cluster_node-tuning-operator[Configuring node tuning in a hosted cluster]: To set node-level tuning on the nodes in your hosted cluster, you can use the Node Tuning Operator. In hosted control planes, you can configure node tuning by creating config maps that contain `Tuned` objects and referencing those config maps in your node pools.
