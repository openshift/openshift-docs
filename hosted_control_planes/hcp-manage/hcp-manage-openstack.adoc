After you deploy {hcp} on {rh-openstack-first} agent machines, you can manage a hosted cluster by completing the
following tasks.

== Configuring additional ports for node pools

You can configure additional ports for node pools to support advanced networking scenarios, such as SR-IOV or multiple networks.

[id="hosted-clusters-openstack-performance"]
== Configuring additional ports for node pools

You can tune hosted cluster node performance on {rh-openstack} for high-performance workloads, such as cloud-native network functions (CNFs). Performance tuning includes configuring {rh-openstack} resources, creating a performance profile, deploying a tuned `NodePool` resource, and enabling SR-IOV device support.

CNFs are designed to run in cloud-native environments. They can provide network services such as routing, firewalling, and load balancing. You can configure the node pool to use high-performance computing and networking devices to run CNFs.
