In the context of {hcp}, a _management cluster_ is an {product-title} cluster where the HyperShift Operator is deployed and where the control planes for hosted clusters are hosted.

The management cluster and worker nodes must run on the same type of infrastructure. For example, you can run both the management cluster and the worker nodes on-premise, such as on a bare-metal platform or on {VirtProductName}. In addition, you can run both the management cluster and the worker nodes on cloud infrastructure, such as {aws-first}. However, you cannot run your management cluster on the cloud and your worker nodes on-premise, or the other way around.

The control plane is associated with a hosted cluster and runs as pods in a single namespace. When the cluster service consumer creates a hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane.
