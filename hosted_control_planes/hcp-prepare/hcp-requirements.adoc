The hosting cluster and workers must run on the same infrastructure. For example, you cannot run your hosting cluster on bare metal and your workers on the cloud. However, the hub cluster and workers do not need to run on the same platform. For example, you might run your hosting cluster on bare metal and workers on {VirtProductName}.

The control plane is associated with a hosted cluster and runs as pods in a single namespace. When the cluster service consumer creates a hosted cluster, it creates a worker node that is independent of the control plane.
