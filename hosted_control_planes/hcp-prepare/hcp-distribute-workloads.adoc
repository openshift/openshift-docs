toc::[]

Before you get started with hosted control planes for {product-title}, you must properly label nodes so that the pods of hosted clusters can be scheduled into infrastructure nodes. Node labeling is also important for the following reasons:

* To ensure high availability and proper workload deployment. For example, you can set the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` label to avoid having the control-plane workload count toward your {product-title} subscription.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are separate from other workloads in the management cluster.
//lahinson - sept. 2023 - commenting out the following lines until those levels are supported for self-managed hypershift
//* To ensure that control plane workloads are configured at one of the following multi-tenancy distribution levels:
//** Everything shared: Control planes for hosted clusters can run on any node that is designated for control planes.
//** Request serving isolation: Serving pods are requested in their own dedicated nodes.
//** Nothing shared: Every control plane has its own dedicated nodes. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the management cluster for your workload. Workloads must not run on nodes where control planes run.
