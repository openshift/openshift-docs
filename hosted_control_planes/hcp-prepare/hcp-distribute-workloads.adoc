Before you get started with {hcp} for {product-title}, you must properly label nodes so that the pods of hosted clusters can be scheduled into infrastructure nodes. Node labeling is also important for the following reasons:

* To ensure high availability and proper workload deployment. For example, to avoid having the control plane workload count toward your {product-title} subscription, you can set the `node-role.kubernetes.io/infra` label.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are separate from other workloads in the management cluster.
* To ensure that control plane workloads are configured at the correct multi-tenancy distribution level for your deployment. The distribution levels are as follows:

** Everything shared: Control planes for hosted clusters can run on any node that is designated for control planes.
** Request serving isolation: Serving pods are requested in their own dedicated nodes.
** Nothing shared: Every control plane has its own dedicated nodes.

For more information about dedicating a node to a single hosted cluster, see "Labeling management cluster nodes".

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not use the management cluster for your workload. Workloads must not run on nodes where control planes run.
