You can deploy {product-title} clusters by using two different control plane configurations: standalone or {hcp}. The standalone configuration uses dedicated virtual machines or physical machines to host the control plane. With {hcp} for {product-title}, you create control planes as pods on a management cluster without the need for dedicated virtual or physical machines for each control plane.
