== Assigning components IAM roles by using the CCO in a hosted cluster on {aws-short}

You can assign components IAM roles that provide short-term, limited-privilege security credentials by using the Cloud Credential Operator (CCO) in hosted clusters on {aws-first}. By default, the CCO runs in a hosted control plane.

[NOTE]
====
The CCO supports a manual mode only for hosted clusters on {aws-short}. By default, hosted clusters are configured in a manual mode. The management cluster might use modes other than manual.
