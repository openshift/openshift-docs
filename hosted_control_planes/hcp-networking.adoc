For standalone {product-title}, proxy support is mainly about ensuring that workloads in the cluster are configured to use the HTTP or HTTPS proxy to access external services, honoring the `NO_PROXY` setting if one is configured, and accepting any trust bundle that is configured for the proxy.

For {hcp}, proxy support involves the following additional use cases.

//cp workloads that need to use a proxy to access external services
include::modules/hcp-proxy-cp-workloads.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
//workers need a proxy to communicate with ignition endpoint
include::modules/hcp-proxy-ignition.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
//workers need proxy to communicate with cp
include::modules/hcp-proxy-api.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
//cp workloads that need access to external services and must use the proxy for the management cluster
