toc::[]

A _hosted cluster_ is an {product-title} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. To configure {hcp} on premises, you must install {mce} in a management cluster. By deploying the HyperShift Operator on an existing managed cluster by using the `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on, you can enable that cluster as a management cluster and start to create the hosted cluster. The `hypershift-addon` managed cluster add-on is enabled by default for the `local-cluster` managed cluster.

You can use the {mce-short} console or the hosted control plane command-line interface (CLI), `hcp`, to create a hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. However, you can xref:../../hosted_control_planes/hcp-import.adoc#hcp-import-disable_hcp-import[disable this automatic import feature into {mce-short}].
