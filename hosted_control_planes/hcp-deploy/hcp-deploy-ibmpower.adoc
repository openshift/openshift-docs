toc::[]

You can deploy hosted control planes by configuring a cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is an {product-title} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The hosting cluster is also known as the _management_ cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The _management_ cluster is not the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.
====

The {mce-short} version 2.5 supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the hosting cluster.

To provision {hcp} on bare metal, you can use the Agent platform. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For more information, see "Enabling the central infrastructure management service".

Each {ibm-power-title} host must be started with a Discovery Image that the central infrastructure management provides. After each host starts, it runs an Agent process to discover the details of the host and completes the installation. An Agent custom resource represents each host.

When you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, HyperShift installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.
