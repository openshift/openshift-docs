= Deploying {hcp} on {ibm-z-title}
:context: hcp-deploy-ibmz

toc::[]

You can deploy {hcp} by configuring a cluster to function as a management cluster. The management cluster is the {product-title} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The management cluster is also known as the _hosting_ cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The _management_ cluster is not the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.
====

You can convert a managed cluster to a management cluster by using the `hypershift` add-on to deploy the HyperShift Operator on that cluster. Then, you can start to create the hosted cluster.

The {mce-short} 2.5 supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the management cluster.

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

To provision {hcp} on bare metal, you can use the Agent platform. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For more information, see _Enabling the central infrastructure management service_.

Each {ibm-z-title} system host must be started with the PXE images provided by the central infrastructure management. After each host starts, it runs an Agent process to discover the details of the host and completes the installation. An Agent custom resource represents each host.

When you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, HyperShift Operator installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.

== Adding {ibm-z-title} agents to the InfraEnv resource

To attach compute nodes to a hosted control plane, create agents that help you to scale the node pool. Adding agents in an {ibm-z-title} environment requires additional steps, which are described in detail in this section.

Unless stated otherwise, these procedures apply to both z/VM and RHEL KVM installations on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}.
