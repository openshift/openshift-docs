= Deploying {hcp} on bare metal
:context: hcp-deploy-bm

toc::[]

You can deploy {hcp} by configuring a cluster to function as a management cluster. The management cluster is the {product-title} cluster where the control planes are hosted. In some contexts, the management cluster is also known as the _hosting_ cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The management cluster is not the same thing as the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.
====

The {hcp} feature is enabled by default.

The {mce-short} supports only the default `local-cluster`, which is a hub cluster that is managed, and the hub cluster as the management cluster. If you have Red{nbsp}Hat Advanced Cluster Management installed, you can use the managed hub cluster, also known as the `local-cluster`, as the management cluster.

A _hosted cluster_ is an {product-title} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. You can use the {mce-short} console or the hosted control plane command-line interface (`hcp`) to create a hosted cluster.

The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see "Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}".

== Creating an InfraEnv resource

Before you can create a hosted cluster on bare metal, you need an `InfraEnv` resource.

== Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal

You can create a hosted cluster or import one. When the Assisted Installer is enabled as an add-on to {mce-short} and you create a hosted cluster with the Agent platform, the HyperShift Operator installs the Agent Cluster API provider in the hosted control plane namespace.
