= Deploying {hcp} on {VirtProductName}
:context: hcp-deploy-virt

toc::[]

With {hcp} and {VirtProductName}, you can create {product-title} clusters with worker nodes that are hosted by KubeVirt virtual machines. {hcp-capital} on {VirtProductName} provides several benefits:

* Enhances resource usage by packing {hcp} and hosted clusters in the same underlying bare metal infrastructure
* Separates {hcp} and hosted clusters to provide strong isolation
* Reduces cluster provision time by eliminating the bare metal node bootstrapping process
* Manages many releases under the same base {product-title} cluster

The {hcp} feature is enabled by default.

You can use the hosted control plane command line interface, `hcp`, to create an {product-title} hosted cluster. The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see "Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into multicluster engine Operator".

== Creating a hosted cluster with the KubeVirt platform

With {product-title} 4.14 and later, you can create a cluster with KubeVirt, to include creating with an external infrastructure.

== Customizing ingress and DNS behavior

If you do not want to use the default ingress and DNS behavior, you can configure a KubeVirt hosted cluster with a unique base domain at creation time. This option requires manual configuration steps during creation and involves three main steps: cluster creation, load balancer creation, and wildcard DNS configuration.

== Configuring additional networks, guaranteed CPUs, and VM scheduling for node pools

If you need to configure additional networks for node pools, request a guaranteed CPU access for Virtual Machines (VMs), or manage scheduling of KubeVirt VMs, see the following procedures.
