toc::[]

You can deploy {hcp} by configuring a cluster to function as a hosting cluster. The hosting cluster is an {product-title} cluster where the control planes are hosted. The hosting cluster is also known as the management cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The management cluster is not the same thing as the _managed_ cluster. A managed cluster is a cluster that the hub cluster manages.
====

The {hcp} feature is enabled by default.

The {mce-short} supports only the default `local-cluster` managed hub cluster. On {rh-rhacm-first} 2.10, you can use the `local-cluster` managed hub cluster as the hosting cluster.

A _hosted cluster_ is an {product-title} cluster with its API endpoint and control plane that are hosted on the hosting cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane. You can use the {mce-short} console or the `hcp` command-line interface (CLI) to create a hosted cluster.

The hosted cluster is automatically imported as a managed cluster. If you want to disable this automatic import feature, see "Disabling the automatic import of hosted clusters into {mce-short}".
