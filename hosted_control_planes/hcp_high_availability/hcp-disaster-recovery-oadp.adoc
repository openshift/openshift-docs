= Disaster recovery for a hosted cluster by using {oadp-short}

toc::[]

You can use the {oadp-first} Operator to perform disaster recovery on {aws-first} and bare metal.

The disaster recovery process with {oadp-first} involves the following steps:

. Preparing your platform, such as {aws-full} or bare metal, to use {oadp-short}
. Backing up the data plane workload
. Backing up the control plane workload
. Restoring a hosted cluster by using {oadp-short}

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites on the management cluster:

* You xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-installing-operator.adoc#oadp-installing-operator[installed the {oadp-short} Operator].
* You created a storage class.
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {oadp-short} subscription through a catalog source.
* You have access to a cloud storage provider that is compatible with {oadp-short}, such as S3, {azure-full}, {gcp-full}, or MinIO.
* In a disconnected environment, you have access to a self-hosted storage provider, for example link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/[{odf-full}] or link:https://min.io/[MinIO], that is compatible with {oadp-short}.
* Your {hcp} pods are up and running.

[id="prepare-aws-oadp_{context}"]
== Preparing {aws-short} to use {oadp-short}

To perform disaster recovery for a hosted cluster, you can use {oadp-first} on {aws-first} S3 compatible storage. After creating the `DataProtectionApplication` object, new `velero` deployment and `node-agent` pods are created in the `openshift-adp` namespace.

To prepare {aws-short} to use {oadp-short}, see "Configuring the {oadp-full} with Multicloud Object Gateway".

== Backing up the data plane workload

If the data plane workload is not important, you can skip this procedure. To back up the data plane workload by using the {oadp-short} Operator, see "Backing up applications".
