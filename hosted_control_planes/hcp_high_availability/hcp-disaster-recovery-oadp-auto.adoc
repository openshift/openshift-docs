= Automated disaster recovery for a hosted cluster by using {oadp-short}

include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: hcp-disaster-recovery-oadp-auto

toc::[]

In hosted clusters on bare-metal or {aws-first} platforms, you can automate some backup and restore steps by using the {oadp-first} Operator.

The process involves the following steps:

. Configuring {oadp-short}
. Defining a Data Protection Application (DPA)
. Backing up the data plane workload
. Backing up the control plane workload
. Restoring a hosted cluster by using {oadp-short}

== Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites on the management cluster:

* You xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-installing-operator.adoc#oadp-installing-operator[installed the {oadp-short} Operator].
* You created a storage class.
* You have access to the cluster with `cluster-admin` privileges.
* You have access to the {oadp-short} subscription through a catalog source.
* You have access to a cloud storage provider that is compatible with {oadp-short}, such as S3, {azure-full}, {gcp-full}, or MinIO.
* In a disconnected environment, you have access to a self-hosted storage provider that is compatible with {oadp-short}, for example link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_data_foundation/[{odf-full}] or link:https://min.io/[MinIO].
* Your {hcp} pods are up and running.

== Backing up the data plane workload

To back up the data plane workload by using the {oadp-short} Operator, see "Backing up applications". If the data plane workload is not important, you can skip this procedure.
