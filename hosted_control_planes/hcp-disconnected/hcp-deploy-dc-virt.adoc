= Deploying {hcp} on {VirtProductName} in a disconnected environment
:context: hcp-deploy-dc-virt

toc::[]

When you deploy {hcp} in a disconnected environment, some of the steps differ depending on the platform you use. The following procedures are specific to deployments on {VirtProductName}.

[id="prerequisites_{context}"]
== Prerequisites

* You have a disconnected {product-title} environment serving as your management cluster.
* You have an internal registry to mirror images on. For more information, see xref:../../disconnected/mirroring/index.adoc#installing-mirroring-disconnected-about[About disconnected installation mirroring].

== Deploying {mce-short} for a disconnected installation of {hcp}

The {mce} plays a crucial role in deploying clusters across providers. If you do not have {mce-short} installed, review the following documentation to understand the prerequisites and steps to install it:

== Configuring TLS certificates for a disconnected installation of {hcp}

To ensure proper function in a disconnected deployment, you need to configure the registry CA certificates in the management cluster and the worker nodes for the hosted cluster.

[id="hcp-dc-virt-hosted"]
== Creating a hosted cluster on {VirtProductName}

A hosted cluster is an {product-title} cluster with its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane.

include::modules/hcp-virt-ingress-dns.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

[id="hcp-dc-virt-ingress-dns-custom"]
=== Customizing ingress and DNS behavior

If you do not want to use the default ingress and DNS behavior, you can configure a KubeVirt hosted cluster with a unique base domain at creation time. This option requires manual configuration steps during creation and involves three main steps: cluster creation, load balancer creation, and wildcard DNS configuration.

[id="hcp-dc-finish"]
== Finishing the deployment

You can monitor the deployment of a hosted cluster from two perspectives: the control plane and the data plane.
