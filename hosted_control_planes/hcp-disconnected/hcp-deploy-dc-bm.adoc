= Deploying {hcp} on bare metal in a disconnected environment
:context: hcp-deploy-dc-bm

toc::[]

When you provision hosted control planes on bare metal, you use the Agent platform. The Agent platform and {mce} work together to enable disconnected deployments. The Agent platform uses the central infrastructure management service to add worker nodes to a hosted cluster. For an introduction to the central infrastructure management service, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.11/html/clusters/cluster_mce_overview#enable-cim[Enabling the central infrastructure management service].

== Deploying {mce-short} for a disconnected installation of {hcp}

The {mce} plays a crucial role in deploying clusters across providers. If you do not have {mce-short} installed, review the following documentation to understand the prerequisites and steps to install it:

== Configuring TLS certificates for a disconnected installation of {hcp}

To ensure proper function in a disconnected deployment, you need to configure the registry CA certificates in the management cluster and the worker nodes for the hosted cluster.

== Creating a hosted cluster on bare metal

A hosted cluster is an {product-title} cluster with its control plane and API endpoint hosted on a management cluster. The hosted cluster includes the control plane and its corresponding data plane.
