How to use this file:

* Use `include::_snippets/glusterfs.adoc[]` to enable the variables on a given
  page.
* When discussing the storage technology itself, just use "GlusterFS", e.g.
  "GlusterFS volumes". It is incorrect to say, for example, "Red Hat Gluster
  Storage volumes".
* When discussing the base project or product, use `{gluster}`.
* When discussing configurations of {gluster} that are managed by heketi, use
  `{gluster-native}` if {gluster} is containerized and `{gluster-external}` if
  it is not containerized.
