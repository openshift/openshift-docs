{ocp} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. You also have the option to xref:../configuring-user-workload-monitoring/preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects-uwm_preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack-uwm[enable monitoring for user-defined projects].

A cluster administrator can xref:../configuring-core-platform-monitoring/preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#preparing-to-configure-the-monitoring-stack[configure the monitoring stack] with the supported configurations. {ocp} delivers monitoring best practices out of the box.

A set of alerts are included by default that immediately notify administrators about issues with a cluster. Default dashboards in the {ocp} web console include visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster. With the {ocp} web console, you can xref:../accessing-metrics/accessing-metrics-as-an-administrator.adoc#accessing-metrics-as-an-administrator[access metrics] and xref:../managing-alerts/managing-alerts-as-an-administrator.adoc#managing-alerts-as-an-administrator[manage alerts].

After installing {ocp}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects. By using this feature, cluster administrators, developers, and other users can specify how services and pods are monitored in their own projects.
As a cluster administrator, you can find answers to common problems such as user metrics unavailability and high consumption of disk space by Prometheus in xref:../troubleshooting/troubleshooting-monitoring-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-monitoring-issues[Troubleshooting monitoring issues].

In {ocp}, you can monitor your own projects in isolation from Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform metrics. You can monitor your own projects without the need for an additional monitoring solution.
