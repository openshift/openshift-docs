You can upgrade the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} {product-version} by using Operator Lifecycle Manager.

You can upgrade {mtc-short} on {product-title} 4.5, and earlier versions, by reinstalling the legacy {mtc-full} Operator.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are upgrading from {mtc-short} version 1.3, you must perform an additional procedure to update the `MigPlan` custom resource (CR).
