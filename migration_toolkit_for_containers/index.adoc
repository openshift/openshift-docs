You can migrate stateful application workloads between {product-title} 4 clusters at the granularity of a namespace by using the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC). To learn more about MTC see xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/about-mtc.adoc#about-mtc[understanding MTC].

[NOTE]
====
If you are migrating from {product-title} 3, see xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/about-migrating-from-3-to-4.adoc#about-migrating-from-3-to-4[about migrating from {product-title} 3 to 4] and xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/installing-3-4.adoc#migration-installing-legacy-operator_installing-3-4[installing the legacy {mtc-full} Operator on {product-title} 3].

[id="mtc-overview-install-mtc"]
== Installing MTC
You must install the Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator that is compatible for your {product-title} version:

* {product-title} 4.6 and later versions: xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/installing-mtc.adoc#installing-mtc[Install the Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator by using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)].
* {product-title} 4.5 and earlier versions: xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/installing-mtc.adoc#configuring-replication-repository_installing-mtc[Manually install the legacy Migration Toolkit for Containers Operator].
