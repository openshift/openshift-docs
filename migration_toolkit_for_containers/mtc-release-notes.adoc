The release notes for {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) describe new features and enhancements, deprecated features, and known issues.

The {mtc-short} enables you to migrate application workloads between {product-title} clusters at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate from xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/about-migrating-from-3-to-4.adoc[{product-title} 3 to {product-version}] and between {product-title} 4 clusters.

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

For information on the support policy for {mtc-short}, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#app_migration[OpenShift Application and Cluster Migration Solutions], part of the _Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy_.
