The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) enables you to migrate application workloads between {product-title} clusters at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate from xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/about-migrating-from-3-to-4.adoc[{product-title} 3 to {product-version}] and between {product-title} 4 clusters.

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.
