The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) enables you to migrate stateful application workloads between {product-title} 4 clusters at the granularity of a namespace.

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

The {mtc-short} console is installed on the target cluster by default. You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the console on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[remote cluster].
