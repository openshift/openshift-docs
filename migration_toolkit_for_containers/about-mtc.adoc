toc::[]

The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) enables you to migrate stateful application workloads between {product-title} 4 clusters at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate applications within the same cluster by using state migration.

{mtc-short} provides a web console and an API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, to help you control the migration and minimize application downtime.

The {mtc-short} console is installed on the target cluster by default. You can configure the {mtc-full} Operator to install the console on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[remote cluster].

See xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/advanced-migration-options-mtc.adoc#advanced-migration-options-mtc[Advanced migration options] for information about the following topics:

* Automating your migration with migration hooks and the {mtc-short} API.
* Configuring your migration plan to exclude resources, support large-scale migrations, and enable automatic PV resizing for direct volume migration.
