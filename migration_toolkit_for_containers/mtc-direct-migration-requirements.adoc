Direct Migration is available with {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) 1.4.0 or later.

There are two parts of the Direct Migration:

* Direct Volume Migration

* Direct Image Migration

Direct Migration enables the migration of persistent volumes and internal images directly from the source cluster to the destination cluster without an intermediary replication repository (object storage).

== Prerequisites

* Expose the internal registries for both clusters (source and destination) involved in the migration for external traffic.

* Ensure the remote source and destination clusters can communicate using {OCP} routes on port 443.

* Configure the exposed registry route in the source and destination {mtc-short} clusters; do this by specifying the `spec.exposedRegistryPath` field or from the {mtc-short} UI.
+
[NOTE]
====
* If the destination cluster is the same as the host cluster (where a migration controller exists), there is no need to configure the exposed registry route for that particular {mtc-short} cluster.

* The `spec.exposedRegistryPath` is required only for Direct Image Migration and not Direct Volume Migration.
====

* Ensure the two spec flags in `MigPlan` custom resource (CR) `indirectImageMigration` and `indirectVolumeMigration` are set to `false` for Direct Migration to be performed. The default value for these flags is `false`.


The Direct Migration feature of {mtc-short} uses the Rsync utility.
