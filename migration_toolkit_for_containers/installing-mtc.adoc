You can install the {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) on {product-title} 4.

[NOTE]
====
To install {mtc-short} on {product-title} 3, see xref:../migrating_from_ocp_3_to_4/installing-3-4.adoc#migration-installing-legacy-operator_installing-3-4[Installing the legacy {mtc-full} Operator on {product-title} 3].
====

By default, the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod run on the target cluster. You can configure the `Migration Controller` custom resource manifest to run the {mtc-short} web console and the `Migration Controller` pod on a link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/5064151[remote cluster].

After you have installed {mtc-short}, you must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository.

To uninstall {mtc-short}, see xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/installing-mtc.adoc#migration-uninstalling-mtc-clean-up_installing-mtc[Uninstalling {mtc-short} and deleting resources].

== Configuring a replication repository

You must configure an object storage to use as a replication repository. The {mtc-full} ({mtc-short}) copies data from the source cluster to the replication repository, and then from the replication repository to the target cluster.

{mtc-short} supports the xref:../migration_toolkit_for_containers/about-mtc.adoc#migration-understanding-data-copy-methods_about-mtc[file system and snapshot data copy methods] for migrating data from the source cluster to the target cluster. Select a method that is suited for your environment and is supported by your storage provider.

{mtc-short} supports the following storage providers:

* Multi-Cloud Object Gateway (MCG)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure Blob
* Generic S3 object storage, for example, Minio or Ceph S3

[id="replication-repository-prerequisites_{context}"]
=== Prerequisites

* All clusters must have uninterrupted network access to the replication repository.
* If you use a proxy server with an internally hosted replication repository, you must ensure that the proxy allows access to the replication repository.
