Red Hat provides you the support to identify and solve issues with your {product-title} cluster. Red Hat offers cluster administrators tools for gathering data for your cluster, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

* xref:../support/getting-support.adoc#getting-support[Get support]:
If you experience issues with {product-title} cluster visit the Red Hat Customer Portal. Through the Red Hat Customer Portal, you can review knowledgebase articles, submit a support case, and review additional product documentation and resources.

* xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#about-remote-health-monitoring[Remote heath monitoring issues]:
{product-title} collects telemetry and configuration data about your cluster and reports it to Red Hat by using the Telemeter Client and the Insights Operator. Red Hat uses this data to know and resolve issues in _connected cluster_. Similar to connected clusters, you can xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/remote-health-reporting-from-restricted-network.adoc#remote-health-reporting-from-restricted-network[Use remote health monitoring in a restricted network]. {product-title} collects data and monitors health using the following:

** *Telemetry*: The Telemeter Client fetches and uploads the metrics values to Red Hat every four minutes and thirty seconds. Red Hat uses this data to:

*** Monitor the clusters
*** Roll out OpenShift Container Platform upgrades
*** Improve the upgrade experience

** *Insight Operator*: The Insights Operator reports configuration and component failure status by default, every two hours to Red Hat. {product-title} installs and enables the Insights Operator by default. Insight Operator helps to:

*** Identify potential cluster issues proactively
*** Provide a solution and preventive action in Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager

You can xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#showing-data-collected-by-remote-health-monitoring[See the data captured by Telemetry and Insights Operator].

If you have enabled remote health reporting, xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster.adoc#using-insights-to-identify-issues-with-your-cluster[Use Insights to identify issues with your cluster]. You can optionally disable remote health reporting.

* xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#gathering-cluster-data[Gather data about your cluster]:
Red Hat recommends gathering your debugging information when opening a support case. This helps Red Hat Support to perform a root cause analysis. A cluster administrator can use the following to gather data about your cluster:

** *The must-gather tool*: Use the `must-gather` tool to collect information about your cluster and to debug the issues.
** *sosreport*:  Use the `sosreport` tool to collect configuration details, system information, and diagnostic data for debugging purposes.
** *Cluster ID*: Obtain the unique identifier for your cluster, when providing information to Red Hat Support.
** *Bootstrap node journal logs*: For bootstrap-related issues, gather `bootkube.service` `journald` unit logs and container logs from the bootstrap node.
** *Cluster node journal logs*: For node-related issues, gather `journald` unit logs and logs within `/var/log` on individual cluster nodes.
** *A network trace*: For network-related issues, provide a network packet trace from a specific OpenShift Container Platform cluster node or a container to Red Hat Support.
** *Diagnostic data*: By using the `redhat-support-tool` command, provide the diagnostic data about your cluster.
** *Toolbox container*:  Gather diagnostic information and provide it to Red Hat Support by using a `toolbox` container.

* Troubleshooting the issues:
A cluster administrator can monitor and troubleshoot the following {product-title} component issues:

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-installations.adoc#troubleshooting-installations[Installation issues]: {product-title} installation proceeds through various stages. You can perform the following:

*** Monitor the installation stages
*** Determine at which stage installation issue occurred
*** Gather the diagnostic data relevant to that stage

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/verifying-node-health.adoc#verifying-node-health[Node issues]: A cluster administrator can verify and troubleshoot node-related issues by reviewing the status, resource usage, and configuration of a node. You can query the following:

*** Kubelet’s status on a node
*** Cluster node journal logs

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-crio-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-crio-issues[Crio issues]: A cluster administrator can verify CRI-O container runtime engine status on each cluster node. If you experience container runtime issues, perform the following:

*** Gather CRI-O journald unit logs
*** Cleaning CRI-O storage

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-operating-system-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-operating-system-issues[Operating system issues]: {product-title}  runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS. If you experience operating system issues, you can investigate kernel crash procedures. Ensure the following:

*** Enable kdump
*** Test the kdump configuration
*** Analyze a core dump

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-network-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-network-issues[Network issues]: To Troubleshoot Open vSwitch issues, A cluster administrator can perform the following:

*** Configure the Open vSwitch log level temporarily
*** Configure the Open vSwitch log level permanently
*** Display Open vSwitch logs

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-operator-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-operator-issues[Operator issues]: A cluster administrator can ensure the following to resolve Operator issues:

*** Verify Operator subscription status
*** Check Operator pod health
*** Gather Operator logs

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/investigating-pod-issues.adoc#investigating-pod-issues[Pod issues]: A cluster administrator can troubleshoot pod-related issues by reviewing the status of a pod and by verifying the following:

*** Review pod and container logs
*** Start debug pods with root access

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-s2i.adoc#troubleshooting-s2i[Source-to-image issues]: A cluster administrator can observe the S2I stages to determine where in the S2I process a failure occurred. Gather the following to resolve Source-to-Image (S2I) issues:

*** Source-to-Image diagnostic data
*** Application diagnostic data to investigate application failure

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-storage-issues.adoc#troubleshooting-storage-issues[Storage issues]: A multi-attach storage error occurs when the mounting volume on a new node is not possible because the failed node is unable to unmount the attached volume. A cluster administrator can verify the following to resolve multi-attach storage issues:

*** Enable multiple attachments by using RWX volumes
*** Recover or delete the failed node when using an RWO volume.

** xref:../support/troubleshooting/investigating-monitoring-issues.adoc#investigating-monitoring-issues[Monitoring issues]: A cluster administrator can follow the procedures on the troubleshooting page for monitoring. If the metrics for your user-defined projects are unavailable or if Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space, check the following:

*** Investigate why user-defined metrics are unavailable
*** Determine why Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space

** xref:../logging/cluster-logging.adoc#cluster-logging[Logging issues]: A cluster administrator can follow the procedures on the troubleshooting page for OpenShift Logging issues. Check the following to resolve logging issues:
