Red{nbsp}Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) typically does not require a elevated access to systems as part of normal operations to manage and support {product-title} clusters. In the unlikely event that SRE needs elevated access to systems, you can use the _Approved Access_ interface to review and _approve_ or _deny_ access to these systems.

Elevated access requests to clusters on {product-rosa} clusters and the corresponding cloud accounts can be created by SRE either in response to a customer-initiated support ticket or in response to alerts received by SRE as part of the standard incident response process.

When _Approved Access_ is enabled and an SRE creates an access request, _cluster owners_ receive an email notification informing them of a new access request. The email notification contains a link allowing the cluster owner to quickly approve or deny the access request. You must respond in a timely manner otherwise there is a risk to your SLA for {product-rosa}.

* If customers require additional users that are not the cluster owner to receive the email, they can link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/observability/logging/sd-accessing-the-service-logs.html#adding-cluster-notification-contacts_sd-accessing-the-service-logs[add additional cluster contacts].
* Pending access requests are available in the {hybrid-console-second} on the clusters list or *Access Requests* tab on the cluster overview for the specific cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Denying an access request requires you to complete the *Justification* field. In this case, SRE can not directly act on the resources related to the incident. Customers can still use the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/#/case/list[*Customer Support*] to help investigate and resolve any issues.
