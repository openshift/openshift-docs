{product-title} includes a preconfigured, preinstalled, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. In {product-title} {product-version}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects.

// Note - please update the following sentence if you add further modules to this assembly.
Use these procedures if the following issues occur:

* Your own metrics are unavailable.
* Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space. 
* The `KubePersistentVolumeFillingUp` alert is firing for Prometheus.
