{product-title} includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. In {product-title} {product-version}, cluster administrators can optionally enable monitoring for user-defined projects.

// Note - please update the following sentence if you add further modules to this assembly.
You can follow these procedures if your own metrics are unavailable or if Prometheus is consuming a lot of disk space.
