A multi-attach storage error occurs when the mounting volume on a new node is not possible because the failed node cannot unmount the attached volume. A cluster administrator can resolve multi-attach storage issues by enabling multiple attachments using RWX volumes or recovering/deleting the failed node when using an RWO volume.
