The Insights Operator periodically gathers configuration and component failure status and, by default, reports that data every two hours to Red Hat. This information enables Red Hat to assess configuration and deeper failure data than is reported through Telemetry. Users of {product-title} can display the report in the {insights-advisor-url} service on {hybrid-console}.

== Running an Insights Operator gather operation

You can run Insights Operator data gather operations on demand. The following procedures describe how to run the default list of gather operations using the OpenShift web console or CLI. You can customize the on demand gather function to exclude any gather operations you choose. Disabling gather operations from the default list degrades Insights Advisor's ability to offer effective recommendations for your cluster. If you have previously disabled Insights Operator gather operations in your cluster, this procedure will override those parameters.

[NOTE]
====
If you enable Technology Preview in your cluster, the Insights Operator runs gather operations in individual pods. This is part of the Technology Preview feature set for the Insights Operator and supports the new data gathering features.
