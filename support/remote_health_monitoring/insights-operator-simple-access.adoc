:FeatureName: `InsightsOperatorPullingSCA`

toc::[]

Insights Operator can import your RHEL Simple Content Access (SCA) certificates from {console-redhat-com}. SCA is a capability in Red Hatâ€™s subscription tools which simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. It is easier to consume the content provided by your Red Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling. After importing the certificates, they are stored in the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. 

Insights Operator imports SCA certificates every 8 hours by default, but can be configured or disabled using the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.

In {product-title} 4.9, this feature is in Technology Preview and must be enabled using the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` Feature Set. See xref:../../nodes/clusters/nodes-cluster-enabling-features.adoc[_Enabling OpenShift Container Platform features using FeatureGates_] for more information.

For more information about Simple Content Access certificates see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/simple-content-access[_Simple Content Access_] article in the Red Hat Knowledgebase.
