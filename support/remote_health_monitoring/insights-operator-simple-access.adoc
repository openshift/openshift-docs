toc::[]

Insights Operator can import your RHEL Simple Content Access (SCA) certificates from {cluster-manager-url}. SCA is a capability in Red Hatâ€™s subscription tools which simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. It is easier to consume the content provided by your Red Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling. After importing the certificates, they are stored in the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace.

Insights Operator imports simple content access certificates every 8 hours by default, but can be configured or disabled using the `support` secret in the `openshift-config` namespace.

For more information about simple content access, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/subscription_central/2021/html-single/getting_started_with_simple_content_access/index#assembly-about-simplecontent[_About simple content access_] in the Red Hat Subscription Central documentation.
