= Importing simple content access entitlements with {insights-operator}

:FeatureName: `InsightsOperatorPullingSCA`

toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
{insights-operator} periodically imports your simple content access entitlements from {cluster-manager-url} and stores them in the `etc-pki-entitlement` secret in the `openshift-config-managed` namespace. Simple content access is a capability in Red{nbsp}Hat subscription tools that simplifies the behavior of the entitlement tooling. This feature makes it easier to consume the content provided by your Red{nbsp}Hat subscriptions without the complexity of configuring subscription tooling.

[NOTE]
====
Previously, a cluster administrator would create or edit the {insights-operator} configuration using a *support secret* in the `openshift-config` namespace. {red-hat-lightspeed} now supports the creation of a `ConfigMap` object to configure the {insights-operator}. The {insights-operator} gives preference to the config map configuration over the support secret if both exist.
====

The {insights-operator} imports simple content access entitlements every eight hours, but can be configured or disabled using the *insights-config* `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-insights` namespace.

[NOTE]
=====
Simple content access must be enabled in Red Hat Subscription Management for the importing to function.
