{product-title} collects telemetry and configuration data about your cluster and reports it to Red Hat by using the Telemeter Client and the Insights Operator. The data that is provided to Red Hat enables the benefits outlined in this document.

A cluster that reports data to Red Hat through Telemetry and the Insights Operator is considered a _connected cluster_.

*Telemetry* is the term that Red Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red Hat by the {product-title} Telemeter Client. Lightweight attributes are sent from connected clusters to Red Hat to enable subscription management automation, monitor the health of clusters, assist with support, and improve customer experience.

The *Insights Operator* gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red Hat. The data is used to produce insights about potential issues that a cluster might be exposed to. These insights are communicated to cluster administrators on link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift[console.redhat.com/openshift].

More information is provided in this document about these two processes.

.Telemetry and Insights Operator benefits

Telemetry and the Insights Operator enable the following benefits for end-users:

* *Enhanced identification and resolution of issues*. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red Hat from a broader perspective across a fleet of clusters. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a Bugzilla.

* *Advanced release management*. {product-title} offers the `candidate`, `fast`, and `stable` release channels, which enable you to choose an update strategy. The graduation of a release from `fast` to `stable` is dependent on the success rate of updates and on the events seen during upgrades. With the information provided by connected clusters, Red Hat can improve the quality of releases to `stable` channels and react more rapidly to issues found in the `fast` channels.

* *Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality*. The data collected provides insights about which areas of {product-title} are used most. With this information, Red Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.

* *A streamlined support experience*. You can provide a cluster ID for a connected cluster when creating a support ticket on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal]. This enables Red Hat to deliver a streamlined support experience that is specific to your cluster, by using the connected information. This document provides more information about that enhanced support experience.

* *Predictive analytics*. The insights displayed for your cluster on link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/[console.redhat.com/openshift] are enabled by the information collected from connected clusters. Red Hat is investing in applying deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence automation to help identify issues that {product-title} clusters are exposed to.

== Additional details about how remote health monitoring data is used

The information collected to enable remote health monitoring is detailed in xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#what-information-is-collected_about-remote-health-monitoring[Information collected by Telemetry] and xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/about-remote-health-monitoring.adoc#insights-operator-what-information-is-collected_about-remote-health-monitoring[Information collected by the Insights Operator].

As further described in the preceding sections of this document, Red Hat collects data about your use of the Red Hat Product(s) for purposes such as providing support and upgrades, optimizing performance or configuration, minimizing service impacts, identifying and remediating threats, troubleshooting, improving the offerings and user experience, responding to issues, and for billing purposes if applicable.

.Collection safeguards

Red Hat employs technical and organizational measures designed to protect the telemetry and configuration data.

.Sharing

Red Hat may share the data collected through Telemetry and the Insights Operator internally within Red Hat to improve your user experience. Red Hat may share telemetry and configuration data with its business partners in an aggregated form that does not identify customers to help the partners better understand their markets and their customers’ use of Red Hat offerings or to ensure the successful integration of products jointly supported by those partners.

.Third party service providers

Red Hat may engage certain service providers to assist in the collection and storage of the telemetry and configuration data.

.User control / enabling and disabling telemetry and configuration data collection

You may disable {product-title} Telemetry and the Insights Operator by following the instructions in xref:../../support/remote_health_monitoring/opting-out-of-remote-health-reporting.adoc#opting-out-remote-health-reporting[Opting out of remote health reporting].
