{product-title} collects telemetry and configuration data about your cluster and reports it to Red{nbsp}Hat by using the Telemeter Client and the {insights-operator}. The data that is provided to Red{nbsp}Hat enables the benefits outlined in this document.

A cluster that reports data to Red Hat through Telemetry and the {insights-operator} is considered a _connected cluster_.

*Telemetry* is the term that Red Hat uses to describe the information being sent to Red Hat by the {product-title} Telemeter Client. Lightweight attributes are sent from connected clusters to Red Hat to enable subscription management automation, monitor the health of clusters, assist with support, and improve customer experience.

The *{insights-operator}* gathers {product-title} configuration data and sends it to Red{nbsp}Hat. The data is used to produce insights about potential issues that a cluster might be exposed to. These insights are communicated to cluster administrators on {cluster-manager-url}.

More information is provided in this document about these two processes.

== Telemetry and {insights-operator} benefits

Telemetry and the {insights-operator} enable the following benefits for end-users:

* *Enhanced identification and resolution of issues*. Events that might seem normal to an end-user can be observed by Red Hat from a broader perspective across a fleet of clusters. Some issues can be more rapidly identified from this point of view and resolved without an end-user needing to open a support case or file a link:https://issues.redhat.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=12332330&summary=Summary&issuetype=1&priority=10200&versions=12385624[Jira issue].

* *Advanced release management*. {product-title} offers the `candidate`, `fast`, and `stable` release channels, which enable you to choose an update strategy. The graduation of a release from `fast` to `stable` is dependent on the success rate of updates and on the events seen during upgrades. With the information provided by connected clusters, Red Hat can improve the quality of releases to `stable` channels and react more rapidly to issues found in the `fast` channels.

* *Targeted prioritization of new features and functionality*. The data collected provides insights about which areas of {product-title} are used most. With this information, Red Hat can focus on developing the new features and functionality that have the greatest impact for our customers.

* *A streamlined support experience*. You can provide a cluster ID for a connected cluster when creating a support ticket on the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/[Red Hat Customer Portal]. This enables Red Hat to deliver a streamlined support experience that is specific to your cluster, by using the connected information. This document provides more information about that enhanced support experience.

* *Predictive analytics*. The insights displayed for your cluster on {cluster-manager-url} are enabled by the information collected from connected clusters. Red Hat is investing in applying deep learning, machine learning, and artificial intelligence automation to help identify issues that {product-title} clusters are exposed to.
