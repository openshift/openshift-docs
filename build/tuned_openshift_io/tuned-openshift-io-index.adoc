== Tuned [tuned.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
Tuned is a collection of rules that allows cluster-wide deployment
of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning
specified by user needs.  These rules are translated and passed to all
containerized Tuned daemons running in the cluster in the format that
the daemons understand. The responsibility for applying the node-level
tuning then lies with the containerized Tuned daemons. More info:
