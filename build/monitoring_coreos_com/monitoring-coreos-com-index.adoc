== Alertmanager [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `Alertmanager` custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster. It allows to specify many options such as the number of replicas, persistent storage and many more.

For each `Alertmanager` resource, the Operator deploys a `StatefulSet` in the same namespace. When there are two or more configured replicas, the Operator runs the Alertmanager instances in high-availability mode.

The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `AlertmanagerConfig` objects should be associated to the deployed Alertmanager instances.

Type::
  `object`

== PodMonitor [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `PodMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` can scrape metrics from a group of pods.
Among other things, it allows to specify:
* The pods to scrape via label selectors.
* The container ports to scrape.
* Authentication credentials to use.
* Target and metric relabeling.

`Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `PodMonitor` objects using label and namespace selectors.

  `object`

== Probe [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `Probe` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how to scrape metrics from prober exporters such as the [blackbox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter).

The `Probe` resource needs 2 pieces of information:
* The list of probed addresses which can be defined statically or by discovering Kubernetes Ingress objects.
* The prober which exposes the availability of probed endpoints (over various protocols such HTTP, TCP, ICMP, ...) as Prometheus metrics.

`Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `Probe` objects using label and namespace selectors.

== Prometheus [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `Prometheus` custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster. It allows to specify many options such as the number of replicas, persistent storage, and Alertmanagers where firing alerts should be sent and many more.

For each `Prometheus` resource, the Operator deploys one or several `StatefulSet` objects in the same namespace. The number of StatefulSets is equal to the number of shards which is 1 by default.

The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, `Probe` and `PrometheusRule` objects should be associated to the deployed Prometheus instances.

The Operator continuously reconciles the scrape and rules configuration and a sidecar container running in the Prometheus pods triggers a reload of the configuration when needed.

  `object`

== PrometheusRule [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `PrometheusRule` custom resource definition (CRD) defines [alerting](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/) and [recording](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) rules to be evaluated by `Prometheus` or `ThanosRuler` objects.

`Prometheus` and `ThanosRuler` objects select `PrometheusRule` objects using label and namespace selectors.
--

Type::
  `object`

== ServiceMonitor [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `ServiceMonitor` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` can scrape metrics from a group of services.
Among other things, it allows to specify:
* The services to scrape via label selectors.
* The container ports to scrape.
* Authentication credentials to use.
* Target and metric relabeling.

`Prometheus` and `PrometheusAgent` objects select `ServiceMonitor` objects using label and namespace selectors.
--

Type::
  `object`

== ThanosRuler [monitoring.coreos.com/v1]

Description::
+
--
The `ThanosRuler` custom resource definition (CRD) defines a desired [Thanos Ruler](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/blob/main/docs/components/rule.md) setup to run in a Kubernetes cluster.

A `ThanosRuler` instance requires at least one compatible Prometheus API endpoint (either Thanos Querier or Prometheus services).

The resource defines via label and namespace selectors which `PrometheusRule` objects should be associated to the deployed Thanos Ruler instances.
--

Type::
  `object`

== AlertmanagerConfig [monitoring.coreos.com/v1beta1]

Description::
+
--
The `AlertmanagerConfig` custom resource definition (CRD) defines how `Alertmanager` objects process Prometheus alerts. It allows to specify alert grouping and routing, notification receivers and inhibition rules.

`Alertmanager` objects select `AlertmanagerConfig` objects using label and namespace selectors.
--

Type::
  `object`
