== EgressRouter [network.operator.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
EgressRouter is a feature allowing the user to define an egress router
that acts as a bridge between pods and external systems. The egress router runs
a service that redirects egress traffic originating from a pod or a group of
pods to a remote external system or multiple destinations as per configuration.

It is consumed by the cluster-network-operator.
More specifically, given an EgressRouter CR with <name>, the CNO will create and manage:
- A service called <name>
- An egress pod called <name>
- A NAD called <name>

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).

EgressRouter is a single egressrouter pod configuration object.

== OperatorPKI [network.operator.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
OperatorPKI is a simple certificate authority. It is not intended for external
use - rather, it is internal to the network operator. The CNO creates a CA and
a certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has both ClientAuth
and ServerAuth extended usages enabled.

	More specifically, given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage:

- A Secret called <name>-ca with two data keys:
  - tls.key - the private key
  - tls.crt - the CA certificate

- A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data key:
  - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s)

- A Secret called <name>-cert with two data keys:
  - tls.key - the private key
  - tls.crt - the certificate, signed by the CA

The CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years, rotated after 9.
The target certificate will have a validity of 6 months, rotated after 3

The CA certificate will have a CommonName of "<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>", where
<timestamp> is the last rotation time.
