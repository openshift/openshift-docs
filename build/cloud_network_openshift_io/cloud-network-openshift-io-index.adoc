== CloudPrivateIPConfig [cloud.network.openshift.io/v1]

Description::
+
--
CloudPrivateIPConfig performs an assignment of a private IP address to the
primary NIC associated with cloud VMs. This is done by specifying the IP and
Kubernetes node which the IP should be assigned to. This CRD is intended to
be used by the network plugin which manages the cluster network. The spec
side represents the desired state requested by the network plugin, and the
status side represents the current state that this CRD's controller has
executed. No users will have permission to modify it, and if a cluster-admin
decides to edit it for some reason, their changes will be overwritten the
next time the network plugin reconciles the object. Note: the CR's name
must specify the requested private IP address (can be IPv4 or IPv6).

Compatibility level 1: Stable within a major release for a minimum of 12 months or 3 minor releases (whichever is longer).
