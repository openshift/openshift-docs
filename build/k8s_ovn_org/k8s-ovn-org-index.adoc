== AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
AdminPolicyBasedExternalRoute is a CRD allowing the cluster administrators to configure policies for external gateway IPs to be applied to all the pods contained in selected namespaces. Egress traffic from the pods that belong to the selected namespaces to outside the cluster is routed through these external gateway IPs.

== ClusterUserDefinedNetwork [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
ClusterUserDefinedNetwork describe network request for a shared network across namespaces.
--

Type::
  `object`

== EgressFirewall [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
EgressFirewall describes the current egress firewall for a Namespace.
Traffic from a pod to an IP address outside the cluster will be checked against
each EgressFirewallRule in the pod's namespace's EgressFirewall, in
order. If no rule matches (or no EgressFirewall is present) then the traffic
will be allowed by default.

== EgressIP [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
EgressIP is a CRD allowing the user to define a fixed source IP for all egress traffic originating from any pods which match the EgressIP resource according to its spec definition.
--

  `object`

== EgressQoS [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
EgressQoS is a CRD that allows the user to define a DSCP value
for pods egress traffic on its namespace to specified CIDRs.
Traffic from these pods will be checked against each EgressQoSRule in
the namespace's EgressQoS, and if there is a match the traffic is marked
with the relevant DSCP value.

  `object`

== EgressService [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
EgressService is a CRD that allows the user to request that the source IP of egress packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints of the corresponding LoadBalancer Service would be its ingress IP. In addition, it allows the user to request that egress packets originating from all of the pods that are endpoints of the LoadBalancer service would use a different network than the main one.

== UserDefinedNetwork [k8s.ovn.org/v1]

Description::
+
--
UserDefinedNetwork describe network request for a Namespace.
