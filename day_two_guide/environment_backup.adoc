Creating an environment-wide backup involves copying important data to assist
with restoration in the case of crashing instances, or corrupt data. After
backups have been created, they can be restored onto a newly installed version
of the relevant component.

In {product-title}, you can _back up_, saving state to separate storage, at the 
cluster level.
The full state of an environment backup includes:

- Cluster data files
- etcd data on each master
- API objects
- Registry storage
- Volume storage

Perform a back up on a regular basis to prevent data loss.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following process describes a generic way of backing up applications and the
{product-title} cluster. It cannot take into account custom requirements.
Use these steps as a foundation for a full backup and restoration procedure 
for your cluster. You must take all necessary precautions to prevent data loss.

Backup and restore is not guaranteed. You are responsible for backing up your own
data.
