=== Node maintenance and next steps

See xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#admin-guide-manage-nodes[Managing nodes] or
xref:../admin_guide/managing_pods.adoc#admin-guide-manage-pods[Managing pods] topics
for various node management options. These include:

* xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#marking-nodes-as-unschedulable-or-schedulable[Marking Nodes as Unschedulable or Schedulable]
* xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#evacuating-pods-on-nodes[Evacuating Pods on Nodes]

A node can reserve a portion of its resources to be used by specific components.
These include the kubelet, kube-proxy, Docker, or other remaining system
components such as *sshd* and *NetworkManager*. See the
xref:../admin_guide/allocating_node_resources.adoc#admin-guide-allocating-node-resources[Allocating
node resources section in the Cluster Administrator guide] for more information.
