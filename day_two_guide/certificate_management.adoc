Over the lifetime of a {product-title} cluster, certificates will enter various
phases of their lifecycle. The following procedures describe how to manage
various parts of that lifecycle.

== Changing an application's self-signed certificate to CA-signed certificate

Some application templates create a self-signed certificate that is then
directly presented by the application to clients. As an example, by default and
as part of the {product-title} Ansible installer deployment process, the metrics
deployer creates self-signed certificates.

These self-signed certificates are not recognized by browsers. To mitigate this
issue, use a publicly signed certificate, then configure it to re-encrypt
traffic with the self-signed certificate.

. Delete the existing route:
+
----
$ oc delete route hawkular-metrics -n openshift-infra
----
+
With the route deleted, the certificates that will be used in the new route with
the re-encrypt strategy must be assembled from the existing wildcard and
self-signed certificates created by the metrics deployer. The following
certificates must be available:
+
- Wildcard CA certificate
- Wildcard private key
- Wildcard certificate
- Hawkular CA certificate
+
Each certificate must be available as a file on the file system for the new
route.
+
You can retrieve the Hawkular CA and store it in a file by executing the
following command:
+
----
$ oc get secrets hawkular-metrics-certificate -n openshift-infra \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.hawkular-metrics-ca\.certificate}' | base64 -d > hawkular-internal-ca.crt
----

. Locate the wildcard private key, certificate, and CA certificate. Place each
into a separate file, such as *_wildcard.key_*, *_wildcard.crt_*, and
*_wildcard.ca_*.

. Create the new re-encrypt route:
+
----
$ oc create route reencrypt hawkular-metrics-reencrypt \
          -n openshift-infra \
          --hostname hawkular-metrics.ocp.example.com \
          --key wildcard.key \
          --cert wildcard.crt \
          --ca-cert wildcard.ca \
          --service hawkular-metrics \
          --dest-ca-cert hawkular-internal-ca.crt
