= Restoring persistent volume claims

You can restore persistent volume claim (PVC) data that you backed up.
You can delete the file and then place the file back in the expected location or
migrate the persistent volume claims. You might migrate if you need to move the
storage or in a disaster scenario when the backend storage no longer exists.

Consult any product documentation for the correct restoration procedures for
specific applications.
