Pruning Images and Containers

Module included in the following assemblies:

The {product-title} environment should be carefully monitored to avoid
situations where the storage available for images and containers is full.

After the environment has been in production for a while, unused containers and
images still hosted on the node hosts can cause major issues if the environment
is not being properly monitored. Such issues include file systems running out of
space or inodes or some other storage problems that can lead to downtime.

=== Container Storage
The `container-storage-setup` tool configures the container storage to fit the
requirements in the `/etc/sysconfig/container-storage-setup` file. It is
recommended to dedicate a block device for container storage to avoid affecting
the operating system file system if the container storage is full.
Depending on the requisites, some storage technologies can be used to store
the containers and the container images such as `devicemapper` or `overlay2`.

NOTE: See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux_atomic_host/7/html/managing_containers/managing_storage_with_docker_formatted_containers[official documentation] for more information about how to setup
different options for containers storage.

To see the current file system used for container storage, see the content
of the `/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage` file:

----
$ sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS="--storage-driver overlay2 "
----

In this example, `overlay2` is the configured driver. Run `docker info` to verify this matches the
runtime information:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo docker info | grep "Storage Driver" -A1
Storage Driver: overlay2
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
----

To be able to use `overlay2` on top of a `xfs` backing file system, the
file system should be created with `-n ftype=1` (default option in {rhel} 7.4).
To ensure the backing file system supports `overlay2`, `xfs_info` can be used:

----
$ sudo xfs_info /var/lib/docker | grep ftype
naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
----

If using a dedicated block device for container storage, the
`/etc/sysconfig/container-storage-setup` file should look like:

[subs=+quotes]
----
DEVS='/dev/vdb'
VG=docker_vol
STORAGE_DRIVER=overlay2
CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_NAME=dockerlv
CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_MOUNT_PATH=/var/lib/docker
CONTAINER_ROOT_LV_SIZE=100%FREE
----

Those parameters used with `container-storage-setup` create a dedicated logical
volume using `xfs` file system and `overlay2` as the storage driver for
containers.

To check the available storage for images and containers when using `overlay2`
and `xfs`, `df` can be used:

----
$ df -h /var/lib/docker
Filesystem                       Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/docker_vol-dockerlv  100G   45G   56G  45% /var/lib/docker
$ df -i /var/lib/docker
Filesystem                        Inodes  IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/docker_vol-dockerlv 52426752 872611 51554141    2% /var/lib/docker
----

The {rhocp} node process contains the embedded `cadvisor` process that exposes
private data structures. To see the actual file system values the node process sees, run:

[subs=+quotes]

$ oc get --raw /stats/summary --server https://app-node-0.example.com:10250

Where `node.fs` is the file system hosting the
`/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.volumes` directory and
`node.runtime.imageFs` is where the images are stored (`/var/lib/docker`)

=== Pruning Old Images and Containers
{rhocp} monitors the old images and containers being hosted in the nodes and
triggers garbage collection processes to clean up the unused ones.

There are some default values that can be tweaked if required in every node's
configuration file located in `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` within the
`kubeletArguments` section.

==== Image Garbage Collection

Image pruning garbage collection tries to remove images not referenced by
running pods by checking every five minutes. There are two options to
tweak the image pruning process:

* `image-gc-high-threshold` - The percent of disk usage which triggers image garbage collection. Default to 85%.
* `image-gc-low-threshold` - The percent of disk usage to which image garbage collection attempts to free. Default to 81%.

This means, by default, when a node reports the container storage is 85% used,
the garbage collector tries to free 5% used storage.

NOTE: As recommended, plan the size of the container storage
to avoid wasting space or triggering the garbage collector too often which increases the risk of
storage hiccups. For example, a 10% free threshold on a 10 GB volume size in an
environment with a lot of containers could trigger the garbage collector too often.

To modify these settings manually edit `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
kubeletArguments:
  image-gc-high-threshold:
    - "*75*"
  image-gc-low-threshold:
    - "*70*"
----

And restart the `atomic-openshift-node` service:

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

It is recommended to use the `Ansible` inventory to modify the setting otherwise
it can be overwritten if running a playbook against the cluster such as the
update playbook. The `openshift_node_kubelet_args` is used as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
openshift_node_kubelet_args={'image-gc-high-threshold': ['*75*'], 'image-gc-low-threshold': ['*70*']}
----

After modifying the `Ansible` variable content, running the installer again
may configure the new settings and restart the services:

----
$ ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

WARNING: The `kubeletArguments` section is overwritten with the content of the
variable when running the playbook, so if more parameters are required such as
`max-pods` they should be present in the variable before running the playbook.

The `atomic-openshift-node` logs show when the image pruning process has been
executed by looking for `imageGCManager` or `Image garbage` messages:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo journalctl -u atomic-openshift-node | grep -E 'imageGCManager|Image garbage'

----

Observe error messages if the pruning process is failing such as:

----
Dec 11 11:26:02 app-node-1.example.com atomic-openshift-node[3390]: E1211 11:26:02.271772    3390 kubelet.go:1170] Image garbage collection failed: wanted to free 2317889740, but freed 0 space with errors in image deletion: [rpc error: code = 2 desc = Error response from daemon: {"message":"conflict: unable to delete 161690d448ba (cannot be forced) - image has dependent child images"}, rpc error: code = 2 desc = Error response from daemon: {"message":"conflict: unable to delete 3a57255d6707 (must be forced) - image is referenced in one or more repositories"}]
----

The image garbage collection process doesn't remove images pulled manually using
`docker pull` or `docker run` related tasks, so if needed, the images
can be deleted using `docker rmi` as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo docker rmi *<my_manually_pulled_image:tag>*
----

In the event of a failure of garbage collection, manual deletion of unused images is required:

----
$ sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -f "dangling=true" -q)
----

WARNING: While not recommended, a more aggressive clean up can be performed
by attempting to delete all the images. 
`docker` protects images it is using; this can be performed as `sudo docker rmi $(sudo docker images -q)`

==== Container Garbage Collection
Old pods are not removed immediately as the user may want to perform some tasks
such as seeing the logs of the failed pod or the failed build using
`oc logs -p`. This leads to stopped containers living in the
nodes. To see the unused containers, perform the following step in any node:

----
$ diff -w -b <(sudo docker ps) <(sudo docker ps -a)
----

{rhocp} performs a garbage collection process for dead containers that can
be tweaked depending on three variables:

* `minimum-container-ttl-duration` is the time since the pod is dead until it can be chosen to be deleted. Default value is set to 1 minute (1m). 0 to disable it.

* `maximum-dead-containers-per-container` is the maximum number of dead containers every single pod (UID, container name) pair is allowed to have. Default value is set to 2. -1 to disable it. For instance, the pod named "myawesomeapp" when instantiated become "myawesomeapp-1-6mp91" that contains a container from "myregistry/myawesomeapp:tag" image and with the default setting, two instances of that container are allowed to be present in the host.

* `maximum-dead-containers` is the maximum number of total dead containers. Default value is set to 240. -1 to disable it.

NOTE: Containers not managed by {rhocp}, such as those created by manual `docker run` commands on
the nodes, are not chosen by the garbage collection process.

Every iteration of the container garbage collection process performs the following steps:

* Retrieve a list of candidate containers to be pruned based on the `minimum-container-ttl-duration` parameter (dead containers older than that parameter)
* Classify the candidates into equivalence classes based on pod and image name membership. For instance, the pod named "myawesomeapp" and its containers.
* Remove all unidentified containers (managed by {rhocp} but with a malformed name).
* For each class that contains more containers than the `maximum-dead-containers-per-container` parameter, sort containers in the class by creation time.
* Start removing containers from the oldest first until the `maximum-dead-containers-per-container` parameter is met.
* If there are still more containers in the list than the `maximum-dead-containers` parameter, the collector starts removing containers from each class so the number of containers in each one is not greater than the average number of containers per class, or <all_remaining_containers>/<number_of_classes>.
* If this is still not enough, sort all containers in the list and start removing containers from the oldest first until the `maximum-dead-containers` criterion is met.

As noticed, the `maximum-dead-containers` setting takes precedence over the `maximum-dead-containers-per-container` setting when there is a conflict.

To modify this settings manually edit `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
kubeletArguments:
  minimum-container-ttl-duration:
  - "1h"
  maximum-dead-containers-per-container:
  - "4"
  maximum-dead-containers:
  - "100"
----

And restart the `atomic-openshift-node` service:

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

It is recommended to use the `Ansible` inventory to modify the setting otherwise
it can be overwritten if running a playbook against the cluster such as the
update playbook. The `openshift_node_kubelet_args` is used as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
openshift_node_kubelet_args={'minimum-container-ttl-duration': ['*1h*'], 'maximum-dead-containers-per-container': ['*4*'], 'maximum-dead-containers': ['*100*']}
----

After modifying the `Ansible` variable content, running the installer again
may configure the new settings and restart the services:

----
$ ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

WARNING: The `kubeletArguments` section is overwritten with the content of the
variable when running the playbook, so if more parameters are required such as
`max-pods` they should be present in the variable before running the playbook.

The `atomic-openshift-node` logs show when the container pruning process has
been executed by looking for `SyncLoop (REMOVE` messages in the `atomic-openshift-node` service, or "Action=remove" in `docker` service:

----
$ sudo journalctl -u atomic-openshift-node | grep 'SyncLoop (REMOVE'
Dec 07 10:19:36 app-node-1.example.com atomic-openshift-node[1642]: I1207 10:19:36.596860    1642 kubelet.go:1826] SyncLoop (REMOVE, "api"): "ruby-ex-2-build_xxx(0eaaeba7-cac5-11e7-b85b-fa163e9f7228)"

----

The garbage collection process does not remove manually started containers
using `docker run` and related tasks, so if needed, those dead containers can be
deleted using `docker rm` as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
$ sudo docker rm *<mycontainer>*
----

In the event of a failure of garbage collection, manual deletion of unused containers is required.
These containers can be deleted as:

----
$ sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
----

WARNING: While not recommended, a more aggressive clean up can be performed
by attempting to delete all containers. `docker` protects its running containers 
from deletion. This can be performed as `sudo docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`

NOTE: In future {rhocp} releases, garbage collection will be deprecated in
favor of a disk eviction based configuration.

=== Disk Eviction Policies

In recent {rhocp} releases, the eviction policies can be configured to prevent
out of disk space and out of memory situations.

An eviction policy allows a node to reclaim needed resources and it is a
combination of an eviction trigger signal with a specific eviction threshold
value. In order to be able to reclaim the resources, the node can proactively
fail one or more pods to trigger the policy.

Evictions can be either hard, where a node takes immediate action on a pod that
exceeds a threshold, or soft, where a node allows a grace period before taking
action.

If an eviction threshold is met, the node reports a condition indicating that
the node is under memory or disk pressure. This prevents the scheduler from
scheduling any additional pods on the node while attempts to reclaim resources
are made.

The node continues to report node status updates at the frequency specified by
the node-status-update-frequency argument, which defaults to 10s.

Disk thresholds are configured in the node configuration file
`/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` as:

----
kubeletArguments:
  eviction-soft:
  - nodefs.available<500Mi
  - nodefs.inodesFree<100Mi
  - imagefs.available<100Mi
  - imagefs.inodesFree<100Mi
  eviction-soft-grace-period:
  - nodefs.available=1m30s
  - nodefs.inodesFree=1m30s
  - imagefs.available=1m30s
  - imagefs.inodesFree=1m30s
  eviction-hard:
  - nodefs.available<500Mi
  - nodefs.inodesFree<100Mi
  - imagefs.available<100Mi
  - imagefs.inodesFree<100Mi
----

NOTE: Quantities can be expressed as percentages by appending a %.

And restart the `atomic-openshift-node` service:

----
$ sudo systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

It is recommended to use the `Ansible` inventory to modify the setting otherwise
it can be overwritten if running a playbook against the cluster such as the
update playbook. The `openshift_node_kubelet_args` is used as:

[subs=+quotes]
----
openshift_node_kubelet_args={"eviction-soft":["nodefs.available<500Mi","nodefs.inodesFree<100Mi","imagefs.available<100Mi","imagefs.inodesFree<100Mi"],"eviction-soft-grace-period":["nodefs.available=1m30s","nodefs.inodesFree=1m30s","imagefs.available=1m30s","imagefs.inodesFree=1m30s"],"eviction-hard":["nodefs.available<500Mi","nodefs.inodesFree<100Mi","imagefs.available<100Mi","imagefs.inodesFree<100Mi"]}
----

After modifying the `Ansible` variable content, running the installer again
may configure the new settings and restart the services:

----
$ ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----

WARNING: The `kubeletArguments` section is overwritten with the content of the
variable when running the playbook, so if more parameters are required such as
`max-pods` they should be present in the variable before running the playbook.

If an eviction threshold has been met and the grace period has passed, the node
initiates the process of reclaiming the pressured resource until it has
observed the signal has gone below its defined threshold.

* If `nodefs` file system has met eviction thresholds, the node frees up disk
space by deleting dead pods and their containers.

* If `imagefs` file system has met eviction thresholds, the node frees up disk
space by deleting all unused images.

If the node is unable to reclaim sufficient disk space on the node it begins
evicting pods by evicting one pod at a time to reclaim disk:

* If the node is responding to inode starvation, it reclaims inodes by evicting
pods with the lowest quality of service first.

* If the node is responding to lack of available disk, it ranks pods first by
quality of service then by disk usage, and evicts pods in that order.

* If `nodefs` is triggering evictions, the node sorts pods based on the usage on `nodefs` (local volumes + logs of all its containers)

* If `imagefs` is triggering evictions, the node sorts pods based on the writable
layer usage of all its containers.

The `atomic-openshift-node` logs show when the eviction process has
been executed by looking for `eviction manager:` messages in the
`atomic-openshift-node` service:
