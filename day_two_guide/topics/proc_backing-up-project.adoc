= Backing up a project

Creating a backup of all relevant data involves exporting all important
information, then restoring into a new project.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, a {product-title} project back up and restore tool is being developed
by Red Hat. See the following bug for more information:

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1303205[bugzilla 1303205].

== Procedure

. List all the relevant data to back up:

. Export the project objects to a `.yaml` or `.json` file.
** To export the project objects into a `project.yaml` file:
+
----
$ oc export all -o yaml > project.yaml
----
** To export the project objects into a `project.json` file:
+
----
$ oc export all -o json > project.json
----

. Export the project's `role bindings`, `secrets`,
`service accounts`, and `persistent volume claims`:
+
----
$ for object in rolebindings serviceaccounts secrets imagestreamtags podpreset cms egressnetworkpolicies rolebindingrestrictions limitranges resourcequotas pvcs templates cronjobs statefulsets hpas deployments replicasets poddisruptionbudget endpoints
do
  oc export $object -o yaml > $object.yaml
done
----

. Some exported objects can rely on specific metadata or references to unique
IDs in the project. This is a limitation on the usability of the recreated
objects.
+
When using `imagestreams`, the `image` parameter of a `deploymentconfig` can
point to a specific `sha` checksum of an image in the internal registry that
would not exist in a restored environment. For instance, running the sample
"ruby-ex" as `oc new-app
centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git` creates an
`imagestream` `ruby-ex` using the internal registry to host the image:
+
----
$ oc get dc ruby-ex -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}"
10.111.255.221:5000/myproject/ruby-ex@sha256:880c720b23c8d15a53b01db52f7abdcbb2280e03f686a5c8edfef1a2a7b21cee
----
+
If importing the `deploymentconfig` as it is exported with `oc export` it fails
if the image does not exist.
+
To create those exports, use the `project_export.sh` in the
`openshift-ansible-contrib` repository, which creates all the project objects in
different files. The script creates a directory on the host running the script
with the project name and a `json` file for every object type in that project.
+
[NOTE]
====
The code in the `openshift-ansible-contrib` repository referenced below
is not explicitly supported by Red Hat but the Reference Architecture team
performs testing to ensure the code operates as defined and is secure.

The script runs on Linux and requires `jq` and the `oc` commands installed and
the system should be logged in to the {product-title} environment as a user that
can read all the objects in that project.

[NOTE]
====
If the original object does not exist, empty files will be created when exporting.
====

. If using `imagestreams`, the script modifies the `deploymentconfig` to use the
image reference instead the image `sha`, creating a different `json` file than
the exported using the `_patched` appendix:
+
----
$ diff dc_hello-openshift.json dc_hello-openshift_patched.json

<             "image": "docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift@sha256:42b59c869471a1b5fdacadf778667cecbaa79e002b7235f8091540ae612f0e14",

[WARNING]
====
The script does not support multiple container pods currently, use it
with caution.
