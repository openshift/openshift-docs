= Restoring application data

You can restore application data by using the `oc rsync` command,
assuming `rsync` is installed within the container image. The Red Hat *rhel7*
base image contains `rsync`. Therefore, all images that are based on *rhel7*
contain it as well. See 
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-operations-rsync[Troubleshooting and Debugging CLI Operations - rsync].

[WARNING]
====
This is a _generic_ restoration of application data and does not take into account
application-specific backup procedures, for example, special export and import
procedures for database systems.
====

Other means of restoration  might exist depending on the type of the persistent volume
you use, for example, Cinder, NFS, or Gluster.

== Procedure

.Example of restoring a Jenkins deployment's application data

. Verify the backup:
+
----
$ ls -la /tmp/jenkins-backup/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x.  3 user     user   20 Sep  6 11:14 .
drwxrwxrwt. 17 root     root 4096 Sep  6 11:16 ..
drwxrwsrwx. 12 user     user 4096 Sep  6 11:14 jenkins
----

. Use the `oc rsync` tool to copy the data into the running pod:
+
----
$ oc rsync /tmp/jenkins-backup/jenkins jenkins-1-37nux:/var/lib
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Depending on the application, you may be required to restart the application.
====

. Optionally, restart the application with new data:
+
----
$ oc delete pod jenkins-1-37nux
----
+
Alternatively, you can scale down the deployment to 0, and then up again:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=0 dc/jenkins
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc/jenkins
