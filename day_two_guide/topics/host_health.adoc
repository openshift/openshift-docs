Host health

To verify that the cluster is up and running, connect to a master instance, and run the following:

----
$ oc get nodes
NAME                  STATUS                     AGE       VERSION
ocp-infra-node-1clj   Ready                      1h        v1.6.1+5115d708d7

ocp-node-w135         Ready                      1h        v1.6.1+5115d708d7

The above cluster example consists of three master hosts, three infrastructure
node hosts, and three node hosts. All of them are running. All hosts in the
cluster should be visible in this output.

The `Ready` status means that master hosts can communicate with node hosts and
that the nodes are ready to run pods (excluding the nodes in which scheduling is
disabled).

A basic etcd health status can be checked with the `etcdctl2` command from any
master instance:

----
# etcdctl2 cluster-health
member 59df5107484b84df is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.156.0.5:2379
member 6df7221a03f65299 is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.156.0.6:2379
member fea6dfedf3eecfa3 is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.156.0.9:2379
cluster is healthy
----

However, to get more information about etcd hosts, including the associated
master host:

----
# etcdctl2 member list
295750b7103123e0: name=ocp-master-zh8d peerURLs=https://10.156.0.7:2380 clientURLs=https://10.156.0.7:2379 isLeader=true
b097a72f2610aea5: name=ocp-master-qcg3 peerURLs=https://10.156.0.11:2380 clientURLs=https://10.156.0.11:2379 isLeader=false
fea6dfedf3eecfa3: name=ocp-master-j338 peerURLs=https://10.156.0.9:2380 clientURLs=https://10.156.0.9:2379 isLeader=false
----

All etcd hosts should contain the master host name if the etcd cluster is
co-located with master services, or all etcd instances should be visible if
etcd is running separately.

[NOTE]
====
`etcdctl2` is an alias for the `etcdctl` tool that contains the proper
flags to query the etcd cluster in v2 data model, as well as, `etcdctl3` for v3 data model.
