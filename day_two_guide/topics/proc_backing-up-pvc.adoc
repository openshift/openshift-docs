PVC backup

= Backing up persistent volume claims

You can synchronize persistent data from inside of a container to a server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Depending on the provider that is hosting the {product-title} environment, the
ability to launch third party snapshot services for backup and restore purposes
also exists. As {product-title} does not have the ability to launch these
services, this guide does not describe these steps. 
====

Consult any product documentation for the correct backup procedures of specific
applications. For example, copying the mysql data directory itself does not
create a usable backup. Instead, run the specific backup procedures of the associated
application and then synchronize any data. This includes using snapshot
solutions provided by the {product-title} hosting platform.

== Procedure

. View the project and pods:
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME           READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
demo-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          2h
demo-2-fxx6d   1/1       Running     0          1h
----

. Describe the desired pod to find the volumes that are currently used by a
persistent volume:
+
----
$ oc describe pod demo-2-fxx6d

Namespace:		test
Security Policy:	restricted

    Environment Variables:	<none>
...omitted...
----
+
This output shows that the persistent data is in the
`/opt/app-root/src/uploaded` directory. 

. Copy the data locally:
+
----
$ oc rsync demo-2-fxx6d:/opt/app-root/src/uploaded ./demo-app
receiving incremental file list
uploaded/
uploaded/ocp_sop.txt
uploaded/lost+found/

sent 38 bytes  received 190 bytes  152.00 bytes/sec
total size is 32  speedup is 0.14
----
+
The `ocp_sop.txt` file is downloaded to the local system to be backed up
by backup software or another backup mechanism.
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also use the previous steps if a pod starts without needing
to use a `pvc`, but you later decide that a `pvc` is necessary. You can preserve
the data and then use the restorate process to populate the new
storage.
