= Deprecating a master host

Master hosts run important services, such as the {product-title} API and
controllers services. In order to deprecate a
master host, these services must be stopped. 

The {product-title} API service is an active/active service, so stopping the
service does not affect the environment as long as the requests are sent to a
separate master server. However, the {product-title} controllers service is an
active/passive service, where the services leverage etcd to decide the active
master. 

////
In order to check the master running the active controller service, see
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc#day-two-guide-controller-role-verification[Controller
role verification].

Deprecating a master host in a multi-master architecture includes removing the
master from the load balancer pool to avoid new connections attempting to use
that master. This process depends heavily on the load balancer used. The steps
below show the details of removing the master from `haproxy`. In the event that
{product-title} is running on a cloud provider, or using a `F5` appliance, see
the specific product documents to remove the master from rotation.

== Procedure

. Remove the `backend` section in the `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration
file. For example, if deprecating a master named `master-0.example.com` using
`haproxy`, ensure the host name is removed from the following:
+
----
backend mgmt8443
    balance source
    mode tcp
    # MASTERS 8443
    server master-1.example.com 192.168.55.12:8443 check
    server master-2.example.com 192.168.55.13:8443 check
----

. Then, restart the `haproxy` service.
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart haproxy
----

. Once the master is removed from the load balancer, disable the API and
controller services:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl disable --now atomic-openshift-master-api
$ sudo systemctl disable --now atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

. Because the master host is a schedulable {product-title} node, follow the
steps in the
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.html#deprecating-node_deprecating-etcd[Deprecating
a node host] section.

. Remove the master host from the `[masters]` and `[nodes]` groups in the
`/etc/ansible/hosts` Ansible inventory file to avoid issues if running any
Ansible tasks using that inventory file.
+
[WARNING]
====
Deprecating the first master host listed in the Ansible inventory file requires
extra precautions. 

The `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt` file is generated
on only the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory. If you 
deprecate the first master host, copy the `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt`
file to the rest of master hosts before the process.
====

. The `kubernetes` service includes the master host IPs as endpoints. To
verify that the master has been properly deprecated, review the `kubernetes`
service output and see if the deprecated master has been removed:
+
----
$ oc describe svc kubernetes -n default
Name:			kubernetes
Namespace:		default
Labels:			component=apiserver
			provider=kubernetes
Annotations:		<none>
Selector:		<none>
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			10.111.0.1
Port:			https	443/TCP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8443,192.168.55.13:8443
Port:			dns	53/UDP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8053,192.168.55.13:8053
Port:			dns-tcp	53/TCP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8053,192.168.55.13:8053
Session Affinity:	ClientIP
Events:			<none>
----
+
After the master has been successfully deprecated, the host where the master
was previously running can be safely deleted.
