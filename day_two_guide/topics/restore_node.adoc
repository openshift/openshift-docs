Restoring a node host

Module included in the following assemblies:

After creating a backup of important node host files, if they become corrupted
or accidentally removed, you can restore the file by copying back the file,
ensuring it contains the proper content and restart the affected services.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Restore the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file:
+
----
# MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cp /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml.old
# cp /backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

[WARNING]
====
Restarting the services can lead to downtime. See
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-node-maintenance[Node
maintenance], for tips on how to ease the process.
====

[NOTE]
====
Perform a full reboot of the affected instance to restore the `iptables`
configuration.
====

. If the issue is an accidental package and its dependencies are removed, reinstall the package.
+
Get the list of the current installed packages:
+
----
$ rpm -qa | sort > /tmp/current_packages.txt
----

. Get the differences:
+
----
$ diff /tmp/current_packages.txt ${MYBACKUPDIR}/packages.txt
1a2
> ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch
----

. Reinstall the missing packages:
+
----
# yum reinstall -y ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch
----

. Restore a system certificate by copying the certificate to the
`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` directory and execute the `update-ca-trust`:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
$ sudo cp ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/my_company.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Always ensure proper user ID and group ID are restored when the files are copied
back, as well as the `SELinux` context.
