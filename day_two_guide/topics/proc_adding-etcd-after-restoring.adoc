= Adding etcd nodes after restoring

After the first instance is running, you can add multiple etcd servers to your cluster.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Get the etcd name for the instance in the `ETCD_NAME` variable:
+
----
# grep ETCD_NAME /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Get the IP address where etcd listens for peer communication:
+
----
# grep ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. If the node was previously part of a etcd cluster, delete the previous etcd data:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. On the etcd host where etcd is properly running, add the new member:
+
----
# etcdctl3 member add *<name>* \
  --peer-urls="*<advertise_peer_urls>*"
----
+
The command outputs some variables. For example:
+
----
ETCD_NAME="master2"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----

. Add the values from the previous command to the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file of the new host:
+
----
# vi /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Start the etcd service in the node joining the cluster:
+
----
# systemctl start etcd.service
----

. Check for error messages:
+
----
ifeval::["{context}" != "downgrade"]
# master-logs etcd etcd
endif::[]
ifeval::["{context}" == "downgrade"]
# journalctl -fu etcd.service
endif::[]
----

. Once you add all the nodes, verify the cluster status and cluster health:
+
----
# etcdctl3 endpoint health --endpoints="https://<etcd_host1>:2379,https://<etcd_host2>:2379,https://<etcd_host3>:2379"
https://master-0.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.423459ms
https://master-1.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.767481ms
https://master-2.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.599694ms

# etcdctl3 endpoint status --endpoints="https://<etcd_host1>:2379,https://<etcd_host2>:2379,https://<etcd_host3>:2379"
https://master-0.example.com:2379, 40bef1f6c79b3163, 3.2.5, 28 MB, true, 9, 2878
https://master-1.example.com:2379, 1ea57201a3ff620a, 3.2.5, 28 MB, false, 9, 2878
https://master-2.example.com:2379, 59229711e4bc65c8, 3.2.5, 28 MB, false, 9, 2878
----

. Add the remaining peers back into the cluster.
