= Adding etcd nodes after restoring

After the first instance is running, you can add multiple etcd servers to your cluster.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Get the etcd name for the instance in the `ETCD_NAME` variable:
+
----
# grep ETCD_NAME /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Get the IP address where etcd listens for peer communication:
+
----
# grep ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. If the node was previously part of a etcd cluster, delete the previous etcd data:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. On the etcd host where etcd is properly running, add the new member:
+
--
** If you use the v2 etcd api, run this command:
+
----
$ etcdctl2 member add <name> <advertise_peer_urls>
----
** If you use the v3 etcd api, run this command:
+
----
# etcdctl3 member add *<name>* \
  --peer-urls="*<advertise_peer_urls>*"
----
--
+
The command outputs some variables. For example:
+
----
ETCD_NAME="master2"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----

. Add the values from the previous command to the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file of the new host:
+
----
# vi /etc/etc/etcd.conf
----

. Start the etcd service in the node joining the cluster:
+
----
# systemctl start etcd.service
----

. Check for error messages:
+
----
$ master-logs etcd etcd
----

. Repeat the previous steps for every etcd node to be added.

. Once you add all the nodes, verify the cluster status and cluster health:
** If you use the v2 etcd api, run the following commands:
+
