= Creating a master host backup

Perform this backup process before any change to the {product-title} 
infrastructure, such as a system update, upgrade, or any other significant 
modification. Back up data regularly to ensure that recent data is
available if a failure occurs.

*{product-title} files*

The master instances run important services, such as the API, controllers.
The `/etc/origin/master` directory stores many important files:

* The configuration, the API, controllers, services, and more
* Certificates generated by the installation
* All cloud provider-related configuration
* Keys and other authentication files, such as `htpasswd` if you use htpasswd
* And more

You can customize {product-title} services, such as increasing the log level or
using proxies. The configuration files are stored in the `/etc/sysconfig`
directory.

Because the masters are also unschedulable nodes, back up the entire
`/etc/origin` directory.

== Procedure

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must perform the following steps on each master node.
====

. Create a backup of the master host configuration files:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
$ sudo mkdir -p ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/sysconfig
$ sudo cp -aR /etc/origin ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc
$ sudo cp -aR /etc/sysconfig/atomic-* ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/sysconfig/
----
+
[NOTE]
====
On a single master cluster installation the configuration file is stored in the
`/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master`. In a multi-master environment, the
configuration files are in the `/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-api` and
`/etc/sysconfig/atomic-openshift-master-controllers` directories.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
The `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt` file is generated
on only the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory. If you 
deprecate the first master host, copy the `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt`
file to the rest of master hosts before the process.
====

. Other important files that need to be considered when planning a backup
include:
+
|===
^|File ^|Description
|`/etc/cni/*` |Container Network Interface configuration (if used)
| `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` |Where the `iptables` rules are stored
| `/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup` |The input file for `container-storage-setup` command
| `/etc/sysconfig/docker` |The `docker` configuration file
| `/etc/sysconfig/docker-network` |`docker` networking configuration (i.e. MTU)
| `/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage` |`docker` storage configuration (generated by `container-storage-setup`)
| `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` |Main configuration file for `dnsmasq`
| `/etc/dnsmasq.d/*` |Different `dnsmasq` configuration files
| `/etc/sysconfig/flanneld` |`flannel` configuration file (if used)
| `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` |Certificates added to the system (i.e. for external registries)
|===
+
Create a backup of those files:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
$ sudo mkdir -p ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/sysconfig
$ sudo mkdir -p ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
$ sudo cp -aR /etc/sysconfig/{iptables,docker-*,flanneld} \
    ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/sysconfig/
$ sudo cp -aR /etc/dnsmasq* /etc/cni ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/
$ sudo cp -aR /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/* \
    ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
----

. If a package is accidentally removed or you need to resore a file that is 
included in an `rpm` package, having a list of `rhel` packages installed on the
system can be useful.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you use Red Hat Satellite features, such as content views or the facts store,
provide a proper mechanism to reinstall the missing packages and a historical
data of packages installed in the systems.
====
+
To create a list of the current `rhel` packages installed in the system:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
$ sudo mkdir -p ${MYBACKUPDIR}
$ rpm -qa | sort | sudo tee $MYBACKUPDIR/packages.txt
----

. If you used the previous steps, the following files are present in the
backup directory:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
$ sudo find ${MYBACKUPDIR} -mindepth 1 -type f -printf '%P\n'

----
+
If needed, you can compress the files to save space:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
$ sudo tar -zcvf /backup/$(hostname)-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz $MYBACKUPDIR
$ sudo rm -Rf ${MYBACKUPDIR}
----

To create any of these files from scratch, the `openshift-ansible-contrib`
repository contains the `backup_master_node.sh` script, which performs the
previous steps. The script creates a directory on the host where you run the 
script and copies all the files previously mentioned.

[NOTE]
====
The `openshift-ansible-contrib` script is not supported by Red Hat, but the
reference architecture team performs testing to ensure the code operates as
defined and is secure.
====

You can run the script on every master host with:

----
$ mkdir ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib.git
$ cd openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/day2ops/scripts
$ ./backup_master_node.sh -h
