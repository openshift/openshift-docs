Restoring a master host

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc

After creating a backup of important master host files, if they become corrupted
or accidentally removed, you can restore the file by copying back the file,
ensuring it contains the proper content and restart the affected services.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Restore the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:
+
----
# MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
# cp /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml.old
# cp /backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)/origin/master/master-config.yaml /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Restarting the master services can lead to downtime. However, you can remove the
master host from the highly available load balancer pool, then perform the
restore operation. Once the service has been properly restored, you can add the
master host back to the load balancer pool.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Perform a full reboot of the affected instance to restore the `iptables`
configuration.
====

. If the issue is an accidental package and its dependencies are removed,
reinstall the package.
+
Get the list of the current installed packages:
+
----
$ rpm -qa | sort > /tmp/current_packages.txt
----

. Get the differences:
+
----
$ diff /tmp/current_packages.txt ${MYBACKUPDIR}/packages.txt
1a2
> ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch
----

. Reinstall the missing packages:
+
----
# yum reinstall -y *ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch*
----

. Restore a system certificate by copying the certificate to the
`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` directory and execute the `update-ca-trust`:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
$ sudo cp ${MYBACKUPDIR}/external_certificates/my_company.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Always ensure the user ID and group ID are restored when the files are copied
back, as well as the `SELinux` context.
