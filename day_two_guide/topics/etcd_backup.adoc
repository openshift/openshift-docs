etcd tasks

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc
////

etcd is the key value store for all object definitions, as well as the
persistent master state. Other components watch for changes, then bring
themselves into the desired state.

{product-title} versions prior to 3.5 used etcd version 2 (v2), while 3.5 and
later use version 3 (v3). The data model between the two versions of etcd is
different. etcd v3 can use both the v2 and v3 data model, whereas etcd v2 can
only use the v2 data model. In an etcd v3 server, the v2 and v3 data stores
exist in parallel and are independent.

For both v2 and v3 operations, you can use the `ETCDCTL_API` environment
variable to use the proper API:

----
$ etcdctl -v
etcdctl version: 3.2.5
API version: 2
$ ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl version
etcdctl version: 3.2.5
API version: 3.2
----

See
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.7/upgrading/migrating_etcd.html[Migrating etcd Data (v2 to v3) section] in the {product-title} 3.7 documentation for
information about how to migrate to v3.

=== Back up and restore etcd

The etcd backup process is composed of two different procedures:

* Configuration backup: Including the required etcd configuration and
certificates
* Data backup: Including both v2 and v3 data model.

The data backup procedure can be done on any host that has connectivity to the
etcd cluster, where the proper certificates are provided, and where the
`etcdctl` tool is installed.

[NOTE]
====
The backup files must be copied to an external system, ideally outside the
{product-title} environment, and then encrypted.
====

==== etcd configuration backup

The etcd configuration files to be preserved are all stored in the `/etc/etcd`
directory of the instances where etcd is running. This includes the etcd
configuration file (`/etc/etcd/etcd.conf`) and the required certificates for
cluster communication. All those files are generated at installation time by the
Ansible installer.

To back up the etcd configuration: 

----
$ ssh master-0
# mkdir -p /backup/etcd-config-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
# cp -R /etc/etcd/ /backup/etcd-config-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
----

[NOTE]
====
The backup is to be performed on every etcd member of the cluster
as the certificates and configuration files are unique.
====

==== etcd configuration restore

The restore procedure for etcd configuration files replaces the appropriate
files, then restarts the service.

If an etcd host has become corrupted and the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file is lost,
restore it using:

----
$ ssh master-0
# cp /backup/yesterday/master-0-files/etcd.conf /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
# restorecon -Rv /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
# systemctl restart etcd.service
----

In this example, the backup file is stored in the
`/backup/yesterday/master-0-files/etcd.conf` path where it can be used as an
external NFS share, S3 bucket, etc.

==== etcd data backup

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

[NOTE]
====
The {product-title} installer creates aliases to avoid typing all the
flags named `etcdctl2` for etcd v2 tasks and `etcdctl3` for etcd v3 tasks.

However, the `etcdctl3` alias does not provide the full endpoint list to the
`etcdctl` command, so the `--endpoints` option with all the endpoints must be
provided.
====

Before backing up etcd:

* `etcdctl` binaries should be available or, in containerized installations, the `rhel7/etcd` container should be available
* Ensure connectivity with the etcd cluster (port 2379/tcp)
* Ensure the proper certificates to connect to the etcd cluster

. To ensure the etcd cluster is working, check its health:
+

----

[discrete]
== Procedure

[NOTE]
====
While the `etcdctl backup` command is used to perform the backup, etcd v3 has
no concept of a "backup". Instead, a "snapshot" may either be taken from a live
member with the `etcdctl snapshot save` command or by copying the
`member/snap/db` file from an etcd data directory.

The `etcdctl backup` command rewrites some of the metadata contained in the
backup (specifically, the node ID and cluster ID), which means that in the
backup, the node loses its former identity. In order to recreate a cluster from
the backup, a new, single-node cluster is created, then the rest of the nodes
join the cluster. The metadata is rewritten to prevent the new node from
inadvertently being joined onto an existing cluster.
====

. Perform the backup:
+
----
# mkdir -p /backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# etcdctl2 backup \
    --data-dir /var/lib/etcd \
    --backup-dir /backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cp /var/lib/etcd/member/snap/db /backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)
----
+
The `etcdctl2 backup` command creates etcd v2 data backup where copying the `db`
file while the etcd service is not running is equivalent to running `etcdctl3
snapshot` for etcd v3 data backup:
+
----
# mkdir -p /backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# etcdctl3 snapshot save */backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)*/db
Snapshot saved at /backup/etcd-<date>/db
# systemctl stop etcd.service
# etcdctl2 backup \
    --data-dir /var/lib/etcd \
    --backup-dir /backup/etcd-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# systemctl start etcd.service
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `etcdctl snapshot save` command requires the etcd service to be running.
====
+
In this example, a `/backup/etcd-<date>/` directory is created, where `<date>`
represents the current date, which must be an external NFS share, S3 bucket, or
any external storage location.
+
In the case of an all-in-one cluster, the etcd data directory is located in
`/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd`

==== Restoring etcd v2 & v3 data

The following restores healthy data files and starts the etcd cluster as a
single node, then adds the rest of the nodes in case an etcd cluster is
required.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Stop all etcd services:
+
----
# systemctl stop etcd.service
----

. Clean the etcd data directories to ensure the proper backup is restored, but
keeping the running copy:
+
----
# mv /var/lib/etcd /var/lib/etcd.old
# mkdir /var/lib/etcd
# chown -R etcd.etcd /var/lib/etcd/
# restorecon -Rv /var/lib/etcd/
----
+
Alternatively, you can wipe the etcd data directory:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In case an all-in-one cluster, the etcd data directory is located in
`/var/lib/origin/openshift.local.etcd`
====

. Restore a healthy backup data file to one of the etcd nodes:
+
----
# cp -R /backup/etcd-xxx/* /var/lib/etcd/
# mv /var/lib/etcd/db /var/lib/etcd/member/snap/db
----
+
Perform this step on all etcd hosts (including master hosts collocated with
etcd).

. Run the etcd service, forcing a new cluster.
+
This creates a custom file for the etcd service, which overwrites the execution
command adding the `--force-new-cluster` option:
+
----
# mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/
# echo "[Service]" > /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf
# echo "ExecStart=" >> /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf
# sed -n '/ExecStart/s/"$/ --force-new-cluster"/p' \
    /usr/lib/systemd/system/etcd.service \
    >> /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf

# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart etcd
----

. Check for error messages:
+
----
$ journalctl -fu etcd.service
----

. Check for health status (in this case, a single node):
+
----
# etcdctl2 cluster-health
member 5ee217d17301 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.8:2379
cluster is healthy
----

. Restart the etcd service in cluster mode:
+
----
# rm -f /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service.d/temp.conf
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl restart etcd
----

. Check for health status and member list
+
----
# etcdctl2 cluster-health
member 5ee217d17301 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.8:2379
cluster is healthy

# etcdctl2 member list
5ee217d17301: name=master-0.example.com peerURLs=http://localhost:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.55.8:2379 isLeader=true
----

. Once the first instance is running, it is safe to restore multiple etcd servers as desired.

*Fix the `peerURLS` parameter*

After restoring the data and creating a new cluster, the `peerURLs` parameter
shows `localhost` instead the IP where etcd is listening for peer
communication:

----
# etcdctl2 member list
5ee217d17301: name=master-0.example.com peerURLs=http://*localhost*:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.55.8:2379 isLeader=true
----

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Get the member ID from the `etcdctl member list` output.

. Get the IP where etcd is listening for peer communication:
+
----
$ ss -l4n | grep 2380
----

. Update the member information with that IP:
+
----
# etcdctl2 member update 5ee217d17301 https://192.168.55.8:2380
Updated member with ID 5ee217d17301 in cluster
----

. To verify, check that the IP is in the output of the following:
+
----
$ etcdctl2 member list
5ee217d17301: name=master-0.example.com peerURLs=https://*192.168.55.8*:2380 clientURLs=https://192.168.55.8:2379 isLeader=true
----

*Add more members*

In the instance joining the cluster:

. Get the etcd name for the instance in the `ETCD_NAME` variable:
+
----
# grep ETCD_NAME /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Get the IP where etcd listens for peer communication:
+
----
# grep ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Delete the previous etcd data:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. On the etcd host where etcd is properly running, add the new member:
+
----
$ etcdctl2 member add <name> <advertise_peer_urls>
----

. The command outputs some variables. For example:
+
----
ETCD_NAME="master2"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="master1=https://10.0.0.7:2380,master2=https://10.0.0.5:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----
+
Add those values to the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file of the new host:
+
----
# vi /etc/etc/etcd.conf
----

. Once those values are replaced, start the etcd service in the node joining
the cluster:
+
----
# systemctl start etcd.service
----

. Check for error messages:
+
----
$ journalctl -fu etcd.service
----

. Repeat the above for every etcd node joining the cluster.

. Verify the cluster status and cluster health once all the nodes joined:
+
----
# etcdctl2 member list
5cd050b4d701: name=master1 peerURLs=https://10.0.0.7:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.0.7:2379 isLeader=true
d0c57659d8990cbd: name=master2 peerURLs=https://10.0.0.5:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.0.5:2379 isLeader=false
e4696d637de3eb2d: name=master3 peerURLs=https://10.0.0.6:2380 clientURLs=https://10.0.0.6:2379 isLeader=false
----
+
----
# etcdctl2 cluster-health
member 5cd050b4d701 is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.0.7:2379
member d0c57659d8990cbd is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.0.5:2379
member e4696d637de3eb2d is healthy: got healthy result from https://10.0.0.6:2379
cluster is healthy
----

==== Restoring etcd for v3

The restore procedure for v3 data is similar to the v2 data.

Snapshot integrity may be optionally verified at restore time. If the snapshot
is taken with `etcdctl snapshot save`, it will have an integrity hash that is
checked by `etcdctl snapshot restore`. If the snapshot is copied from the data
directory, there is no integrity hash and it will only restore by using
`--skip-hash-check`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The procedure to restore only the v3 data must be performed on a single etcd
host. You can then add the rest of the nodes to the cluster.
====

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Stop all etcd services:
+
----
# systemctl stop etcd.service
----

. Clear all old data, because `etcdctl` recreates it in the node where the
restore procedure is going to be performed:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd
----

. Use the `snapshot restore` command with the data from `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` to
match the following command:
+
----
# etcdctl3 snapshot restore /backup/etcd-xxxxxx/backup.db \
  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd \
  --name master-0.example.com \
  --initial-cluster "master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380" \ --initial-cluster-token "etcd-cluster-1" \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls https://192.168.55.8:2380

----

. Restore permissions and `selinux` context to the restored files:
+
----
# chown -R etcd.etcd /var/lib/etcd/
# restorecon -Rv /var/lib/etcd
----

. Start the etcd service:
+
----
# systemctl start etcd
----

. Check for any error messages:
+
----
$ journalctl -fu etcd.service
----

*Adding more nodes*

Once the first instance is running, it is safe to restore multiple etcd servers as desired.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Get the etcd name for the instance in the `ETCD_NAME` variable:
+
----
# grep ETCD_NAME /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. Get the IP where etcd listens for peer communication:
+
----
# grep ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----

. On the etcd host where etcd is still running, add the new member:
+
----
# etcdctl3 member add *<name>* \
  --peer-urls="*<advertise_peer_urls>*"
----

. The command outputs some variables. For example:
+
----
ETCD_NAME="master2"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----
+
Add those values to the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file of the new host:
+
----
# vi /etc/etc/etcd.conf
----

. In the recently added etcd node, clean the etcd data directories to ensure the
proper backup is restored keeping the running copy:
+
----
# mv /var/lib/etcd /var/lib/etcd.old
# mkdir /var/lib/etcd
# chown -R etcd.etcd /var/lib/etcd/
# restorecon -Rv /var/lib/etcd/
----
+
or wipe the etcd data directory:
+
----
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. Start the etcd service in the recently added etcd host:
+
----
# systemctl start etcd
----

. Check for errors:
+
----
# journalctl -fu etcd.service
----

. Repeat the previous steps for every etcd node that is required to be added.

. Verify the cluster has been properly set:
+
----

[[scaling-etcd]]
=== Scaling etcd

Scaling the etcd cluster can be performed vertically by adding more resources to
the etcd hosts, or horizontally by adding more etcd hosts.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the voting system etcd uses, the cluster must always contain an odd
number of members.
====

The new host requires a fresh RHEL7 dedicated host. The etcd storage should be
located on an SSD disk to achieve maximum performance and ideally on a dedicated
disk mounted in `/var/lib/etcd`.

[NOTE]
====
{product-title} version 3.7 ships with an automated way to add a new etcd host
using Ansible.
====

[discrete]
== Prerequisites

. Before adding a new etcd host, perform a backup of both etcd configuration and
data to prevent data loss.

. Check the current etcd cluster status to avoid adding new hosts to an
unhealthy cluster:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
          --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \
          --peers="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-2.example.com*:2379"\
          cluster-health
member 5ee217d19001 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.12:2379
member 2a529ba1840722c0 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.8:2379
member ed4f0efd277d7599 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.13:2379
cluster is healthy
----
+
Or, using etcd v3 API:
+
----
# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert="/etc/etcd/peer.crt" \
          --key=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --cacert="/etc/etcd/ca.crt" \
          --endpoints="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-2.example.com*:2379"
            endpoint health
https://master-0.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 5.011358ms
https://master-1.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.305173ms
https://master-2.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.388772ms
----

. Before running the `scaleup` playbook, ensure the new host is registered to
the proper Red Hat software channels:
+
----
# subscription-manager register \
    --username=*<username>* --password=*<password>*
# subscription-manager attach --pool=*<poolid>*
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
+
etcd is hosted in the `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms` software channel.

==== Adding a new etcd host using Ansible

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Modify the Ansible inventory file and create a new group named `[new_etcd]`
and add the new host. Then, add the `new_etcd` group as a child of the `[OSEv3]`
group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
etcd
<new_etcd>

... [OUTPUT ABBREVIATED] ...

[etcd]
master-0.example.com
master-1.example.com
master-2.example.com

[new_etcd]
etcd0.example.com
----

. Run the etcd `scaleup` playbook from the host that executed the initial
installation and where the Ansible inventory file is:
+
----
$ ansible-playbook  /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-etcd/scaleup.yml
----

. Once the above has finished, modify the inventory file to reflect the current
status by moving the new etcd host from the `[new_etcd]` group to the `[etcd]`
group:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
etcd
<new_etcd>

... [OUTPUT ABBREVIATED] ...

[etcd]
master-0.example.com
master-1.example.com
master-2.example.com
etcd0.example.com
----

. If using Flannel, modify the `flanneld` service configuration, located at
`/etc/sysconfig/flanneld` on every {product-title} host, to include the new etcd
host:
+
----
FLANNEL_ETCD_ENDPOINTS=https://master-0.example.com:2379,https://master-1.example.com:2379,https://master-2.example.com:2379,https://etcd0.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the `flanneld` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart flanneld.service
----

==== Manually adding a new etcd host

The following steps can be performed on any etcd member. If using the Ansible
installer, the first host provided in the `[etcd]` Ansible inventory is used to
generate the etcd configuration and certificates stored in
`/etc/etcd/generated_certs`, so perform the next steps in that etcd host.

*Steps to be performed on the current etcd cluster*

[discrete]
== Procedure

. In order to create the etcd certificates, run the `openssl` command with the
proper values. To make this process easier, create some environment variables:
+
----
export NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME="*etcd0.example.com*"
export NEW_ETCD_IP="192.168.55.21"

export CN=$NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME
export SAN="IP:${NEW_ETCD_IP}"
export PREFIX="/etc/etcd/generated_certs/etcd-$CN/"
export OPENSSLCFG="/etc/etcd/ca/openssl.cnf"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The custom `openssl` extensions used as `etcd_v3_ca_*` include the
$SAN environment variable as `subjectAltName`. See `/etc/etcd/ca/openssl.cnf`
for more information.
====

. Create the directory where the configuration and certificates are stored:
+
----
# mkdir -p ${PREFIX}
----

. Create the server certificate request and sign it:
+
----
# openssl req -new -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -keyout ${PREFIX}server.key  \
    -out ${PREFIX}server.csr \
    -reqexts etcd_v3_req -batch -nodes \
    -subj /CN=$CN

# openssl ca -name etcd_ca -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -out ${PREFIX}server.crt \
    -in ${PREFIX}server.csr \
    -extensions etcd_v3_ca_server -batch
----

. Create the peer certificate request and sign it:
+
----
# openssl req -new -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -keyout ${PREFIX}peer.key \
    -out ${PREFIX}peer.csr \
    -reqexts etcd_v3_req -batch -nodes \
    -subj /CN=$CN

# openssl ca -name etcd_ca -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
  -out ${PREFIX}peer.crt \
  -in ${PREFIX}peer.csr \
  -extensions etcd_v3_ca_peer -batch
----

. Copy the current etcd configuration and `ca.crt` files from the current node
as examples to be modified later:
+
----
# cp /etc/etcd/etcd.conf ${PREFIX}
# cp /etc/etcd/ca.crt ${PREFIX}
----

. Add the new host to the etcd cluster. Note the new host is not configured yet
so the status stays as `unstarted` until the new host is properly configured:
+
----
# etcdctl2 member add ${NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME} https://${NEW_ETCD_IP}:2380
----
+
This command outputs the following variables:
+
----
ETCD_NAME="<NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME>"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="<NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME>=https://<NEW_HOST_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER1_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER2_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER2_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER2_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER3_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER3_IP>:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----

. Those values must be overwritten by the current ones in the sample
`${PREFIX}/etcd.conf` file. Also, modify the following variables with the new
host IP (`${NEW_ETCD_IP}` can be used) in that file:
+
----
ETCD_LISTEN_PEER_URLS
ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS
ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS
ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS
----

. Modify the `${PREFIX}/etcd.conf` file and check for syntax errors or missing
IPs otherwise the etcd service could fail:
+
----
# vi ${PREFIX}/etcd.conf
----

. Once the file has been properly modified, a `tgz` file with the certificates,
the sample configuration file, and the `ca` is created and copied to the new
host:
+
----
# tar -czvf /etc/etcd/generated_certs/${CN}.tgz -C ${PREFIX} .
# scp /etc/etcd/generated_certs/${CN}.tgz ${CN}:/tmp/
----

*Steps to be performed on the new etcd host*

The new host is required to be subscribed to the proper Red Hat software
channels as explained above in the prerequisites section.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Install `iptables-services` to provide iptables utilities to open the required
ports for etcd:
+
----
# yum install -y iptables-services
----

. Create firewall rules to allow etcd to communicate:
+
* Port 2379/tcp for clients
* Port 2380/tcp for peer communication
+
----
# systemctl enable iptables.service --now
# iptables -N OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW
# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -j OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 2379 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 2380 -j ACCEPT
# iptables-save | tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, a new chain `OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW` is created, which is the
standard naming the {product-title} installer uses for firewall rules.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
If the environment is hosted in an IaaS environment, modify the security groups
for the instance to allow incoming traffic to those ports as well.
====

. Install etcd software:
+
----
# yum install -y etcd
----

. Ensure the service is not running:
+
----
# systemctl disable etcd --now
----

. Remove any etcd configuration and data:
+
----
# rm -Rf /etc/etcd/*
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. Untar the certificates and configuration files
+
----
# tar xzvf /tmp/etcd0.example.com.tgz -C /etc/etcd/
----

. Restore etcd configuration and data owner:
+
----
# chown -R etcd.etcd /etc/etcd/
# chown -R etcd.etcd /var/lib/etcd/
----

. Start etcd on the new host:
+
----
# systemctl enable etcd --now
----

. Verify the host has been added to the cluster and the current cluster health:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
          --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \

*Steps to be performed on all {product-title} masters*

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Modify the master configuration to add the new etcd host to the list of the
etcd servers {product-title} uses to store the data, located in the
`etcClientInfo` section of the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file on
every master:
+
----
etcdClientInfo:
  ca: master.etcd-ca.crt
  certFile: master.etcd-client.crt
  keyFile: master.etcd-client.key
  urls:
    - https://master-0.example.com:2379
    - https://master-1.example.com:2379
    - https://master-2.example.com:2379
    - https://etcd0.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the master API service on every master:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
+
Or, on a single master cluster installation
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----

[WARNING]
====
The number of etcd nodes must be odd, so at least two hosts must be added.
====

. If using Flannel, the `flanneld` service configuration located at
`/etc/sysconfig/flanneld` on every {product-title} host must be modified to
include the new etcd host:
+
----
FLANNEL_ETCD_ENDPOINTS=https://master-0.example.com:2379,https://master-1.example.com:2379,https://master-2.example.com:2379,https://etcd0.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the `flanneld` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart flanneld.service

=== Removing an etcd host

An etcd host can fail beyond restoration. This section walks through removing
the failed etcd host from the cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure the etcd cluster maintains quorum while removing the etcd host, by
removing a single host at a time from a cluster.
====

*Steps to be performed on all masters hosts*

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Edit the failed etcd host out of the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml`
master configuration file on every master:
+
----
etcdClientInfo:
  ca: master.etcd-ca.crt
  certFile: master.etcd-client.crt
  keyFile: master.etcd-client.key
  urls:
    - https://master-0.example.com:2379
    - https://master-1.example.com:2379
    - https://master-2.example.com:2379 <1>
----
<1> The host to be removed.

. Restart the master API service on every master:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
+
Or, if using a single master cluster installation: 
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----

*Steps to be performed in the current etcd cluster*

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Remove the failed host from the cluster by running the following on a
functioning etcd host:
+
----
# etcdctl2 cluster-health

member ed4f0efd277d7599 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.13:2379
cluster is healthy
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `remove` command requires the etcd ID, not the hostname.
====

. To ensure the etcd configuration does not use the failed host when the etcd
service is restarted, modify the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file on all remaining
etcd hosts and remove the failed host in the value for the
`ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER` variable:
+
----
# vi /etc/etcd/etcd.conf
----
+
For example:
+
----
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER=master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380,master-1.example.com=https://192.168.55.12:2380,master-2.example.com=https://192.168.55.13:2380
----
+
becomes:
+
----
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER=master-0.example.com=https://192.168.55.8:2380,master-1.example.com=https://192.168.55.12:2380
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Restarting the etcd services is not required, because the failed host has been
removed using `etcdctl` on the command line.
====

. Modify the Ansible inventory file to reflect the current status of the cluster
and to avoid issues if running a playbook:
+
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
etcd

... [OUTPUT ABBREVIATED] ...

[etcd]
master-0.example.com
master-1.example.com
----

. If using Flannel, modify the `flanneld` service configuration located at
`/etc/sysconfig/flanneld` on every host and remove the etcd host:
+
----
FLANNEL_ETCD_ENDPOINTS=https://master-0.example.com:2379,https://master-1.example.com:2379,https://master-2.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the `flanneld` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart flanneld.service
----

==== Replacing an etcd host

Before you remove the etcd host, scale up the etcd cluster with the new host
using the scale up Ansible playbook or the manual procedure in
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#scaling-etcd[Scaling etcd]. This
ensures that you keep quorum if you lose an etcd host during the replacing
procedure. Then, you can remove the etcd node from the cluster following the
steps from
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#removing-an-etcd-host[Removing an
etcd host].

[WARNING]
====
The etcd cluster should maintain a quorum during the replacement operation. This
means that at least one host should be in operation at all times.

If the host replacement operation occurs while the etcd cluster maintains a
quorum, cluster operations are not affected, except if there is a large etcd
data to replicate where some operations can be slowed down.
====

[NOTE]
====
Ensure a backup of etcd data and configuration files exists before any procedure
involving the etcd cluster to ensure restoration in the case of failure.
====
