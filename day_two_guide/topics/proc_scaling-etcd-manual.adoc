= Manually adding a new etcd host

[discrete]
== Procedure

[discrete]
=== Modify the current etcd cluster

To create the etcd certificates, run the `openssl` command, replacing the values
with those from your environment. 

. Create some environment variables:
+
----
export NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME="*etcd0.example.com*"
export NEW_ETCD_IP="192.168.55.21"

export CN=$NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME
export SAN="IP:${NEW_ETCD_IP}"
export PREFIX="/etc/etcd/generated_certs/etcd-$CN/"
export OPENSSLCFG="/etc/etcd/ca/openssl.cnf"
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The custom `openssl` extensions used as `etcd_v3_ca_*` include the
$SAN environment variable as `subjectAltName`. See `/etc/etcd/ca/openssl.cnf`
for more information.
====

. Create the directory to store the configuration and certificates:
+
----
# mkdir -p ${PREFIX}
----

. Create the server certificate request and sign it:
(*_server.csr_* and *_server.crt_*)
+
----
# openssl req -new -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -keyout ${PREFIX}server.key  \
    -out ${PREFIX}server.csr \
    -reqexts etcd_v3_req -batch -nodes \
    -subj /CN=$CN

# openssl ca -name etcd_ca -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -out ${PREFIX}server.crt \
    -in ${PREFIX}server.csr \
    -extensions etcd_v3_ca_server -batch
----

. Create the peer certificate request and sign it:
(*_peer.csr_* and *_peer.crt_*)
+
----
# openssl req -new -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
    -keyout ${PREFIX}peer.key \
    -out ${PREFIX}peer.csr \
    -reqexts etcd_v3_req -batch -nodes \
    -subj /CN=$CN

# openssl ca -name etcd_ca -config ${OPENSSLCFG} \
  -out ${PREFIX}peer.crt \
  -in ${PREFIX}peer.csr \
  -extensions etcd_v3_ca_peer -batch
----

. Copy the current etcd configuration and `ca.crt` files from the current node
as examples to modify later:
+
----
# cp /etc/etcd/etcd.conf ${PREFIX}
# cp /etc/etcd/ca.crt ${PREFIX}
----

. While still on the surviving etcd host, add the new host to the cluster. 
To add additional etcd members to the cluster, you must first adjust the default
*localhost* peer in the `*peerURLs*` value for the first member:

.. Get the member ID for the first member using the `member list` command:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
    --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \
    --peers="https://172.18.1.18:2379,https://172.18.9.202:2379,https://172.18.0.75:2379" \ <1>
    member list
----
+
<1> Ensure that you specify the URLs of only active etcd members in the 
`--peers` parameter value.

.. Obtain the IP address where etcd listens for cluster peers:
+
----
$ ss -l4n | grep 2380
----

.. Update the value of `*peerURLs*` using the `etcdctl member update` command by
passing the member ID and IP address obtained from the previous steps:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
    --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
    --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \
    --peers="https://172.18.1.18:2379,https://172.18.9.202:2379,https://172.18.0.75:2379" \
    member update 511b7fb6cc0001 https://172.18.1.18:2380
----
.. Re-run the `member list` command and ensure the peer URLs no longer include
*localhost*.


. Add the new host to the etcd cluster. Note that the new host is not yet 
configured, so the status stays as `unstarted` until the you configure the new 
host.
+
[WARNING]
====
You must add each member and bring it online one at a time. When you add
each additional member to the cluster, you must adjust the `*peerURLs*` list
for the current peers. The `*peerURLs*` list grows by one for each member added.
The `etcdctl member add` command outputs the values that you must set in the
*_etcd.conf_* file as you add each member, as described in the following
instructions.
====
+
----
# etcdctl -C https://${CURRENT_ETCD_HOST}:2379 \
  --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt     \
  --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt     \
  --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key member add ${NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME} https://${NEW_ETCD_IP}:2380 <1>
  
Added member named 10.3.9.222 with ID 4e1db163a21d7651 to cluster  

ETCD_NAME="<NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME>"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER="<NEW_ETCD_HOSTNAME>=https://<NEW_HOST_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER1_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER2_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER2_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER2_IP>:2380,<CLUSTERMEMBER3_NAME>=https:/<CLUSTERMEMBER3_IP>:2380"
ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE="existing"
----
<1> In this line, `10.3.9.222` is a label for the etcd member. You can specify
the host name, IP address, or a simple name.

. Update the sample `${PREFIX}/etcd.conf` file.
.. Replace the following values with the values generated in the previous step:
+
* ETCD_NAME
* ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER
* ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER_STATE
+
.. Modify the following variables with the new host IP from the output of the 
previous step. You can use `${NEW_ETCD_IP}` as the value.
+
----
ETCD_LISTEN_PEER_URLS
ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS
ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS
ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLIENT_URLS
----
.. If you previously used the member system as an etcd node, you must overwrite 
the current values in the *_/etc/etcd/etcd.conf_* file.
.. Check the file for syntax errors or missing IP addresses, otherwise the etcd
service might fail:
+
----
# vi ${PREFIX}/etcd.conf
----

. On the node that hosts the installation files, update the `[etcd]` hosts group
in the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* inventory file. Remove the old etcd hosts and
add the new ones.

. Create a `tgz` file that contains the certificates, the sample configuration
file, and the `ca` and copy it to the new host:
+
----
# tar -czvf /etc/etcd/generated_certs/${CN}.tgz -C ${PREFIX} .
# scp /etc/etcd/generated_certs/${CN}.tgz ${CN}:/tmp/
----

[discrete]
=== Modify the new etcd host

. Install `iptables-services` to provide iptables utilities to open the required
ports for etcd:
+
----
# yum install -y iptables-services
----

. Create the `OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW` firewall rules to allow etcd to communicate:
+
* Port 2379/tcp for clients
* Port 2380/tcp for peer communication
+
----
# systemctl enable iptables.service --now
# iptables -N OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW
# iptables -t filter -I INPUT -j OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 2379 -j ACCEPT
# iptables -A OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 2380 -j ACCEPT
# iptables-save | tee /etc/sysconfig/iptables
----
+
[NOTE]
====
In this example, a new chain `OS_FIREWALL_ALLOW` is created, which is the
standard naming the {product-title} installer uses for firewall rules.
====
+
[WARNING]
====
If the environment is hosted in an IaaS environment, modify the security groups
for the instance to allow incoming traffic to those ports as well.
====

. Install etcd:
+
----
# yum install -y etcd
----
+
Ensure version `etcd-2.3.7-4.el7.x86_64` or greater is installed,

. Ensure the etcd service is not running:
+
----
# systemctl disable etcd --now
----

. Remove any etcd configuration and data:
+
----
# rm -Rf /etc/etcd/*
# rm -Rf /var/lib/etcd/*
----

. Extract the certificates and configuration files:
+
----
# tar xzvf /tmp/etcd0.example.com.tgz -C /etc/etcd/
----

. Modify the file ownership permissions:
+
----
# chown -R etcd/etcd /etc/etcd/*
# chown -R etcd/etcd /var/lib/etcd/
----

. Start etcd on the new host:
+
----
# systemctl enable etcd --now
----

. Verify that the host is part of the cluster and the current cluster health:
** If you use the v2 etcd api, run the following command:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
          --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \
          --peers="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-2.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*etcd0.example.com*:2379"\
          cluster-health

cluster is healthy
----
** If you use the v3 etcd api, run the following command:
+
----
# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert="/etc/etcd/peer.crt" \
          --key=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --cacert="/etc/etcd/ca.crt" \
          --endpoints="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-2.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*etcd0.example.com*:2379"\
            endpoint health
https://master-0.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 5.011358ms
https://master-1.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.305173ms
https://master-2.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.388772ms
https://etcd0.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.498829ms

[discrete]
=== Modify each {product-title} master

. Modify the master configuration in the `etcClientInfo` section of the
`/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file on every master. Add the new etcd 
host to the list of the etcd servers {product-title} uses to store the data,
and remove any failed etcd hosts:
+
----
etcdClientInfo:
  ca: master.etcd-ca.crt
  certFile: master.etcd-client.crt
  keyFile: master.etcd-client.key
  urls:
    - https://master-0.example.com:2379
    - https://master-1.example.com:2379
    - https://master-2.example.com:2379
    - https://etcd0.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the master API service:
+
** On every master:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master-api
----
+
** Or, on a single master cluster installation:
+
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
+
[WARNING]
====
The number of etcd nodes must be odd, so you must add at least two hosts.
====

. If you use Flannel, modify the `flanneld` service configuration located at
`/etc/sysconfig/flanneld` on every {product-title} host to include the new etcd
host:
+
----
FLANNEL_ETCD_ENDPOINTS=https://master-0.example.com:2379,https://master-1.example.com:2379,https://master-2.example.com:2379,https://etcd0.example.com:2379
----

. Restart the `flanneld` service:
+
----
# systemctl restart flanneld.service
----
