Entropy

Module included in the following assemblies:

{product-title} uses entropy to generate random numbers for objects such as IDs
or SSL traffic. These operations wait until there is enough entropy to complete
the task. Without enough entropy, the kernel is not able to generate these
random numbers with sufficient speed, which can lead to timeouts and the refusal
of secure connections.

To check available entropy:

----
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
2683
----

The available entropy should be verified on all node hosts in the cluster.
Ideally, this value should be above `1000`.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends monitoring this value and issuing an alert if the value is
under `800`.
====

Alternatively, you can use the `rngtest` command to check not only the available
entropy, but if your system can _feed_ enough entropy as well:

----
$ cat /dev/random | rngtest -c 100
----

The `rngtest` command is available from the `rng-tools`

If the above takes around 30 seconds to complete, then there is not enough
entropy available.

Depending on your environment, entropy can be increased in multiple ways. For
more information, see the following blog post:
link:https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/10/05/entropy-rhel-based-cloud-instances/[].

Generally, you can increase entropy by installing the `rng-tools` package and
enabling the `rngd` service:

----
# yum install rng-tools
# systemctl enable --now rngd
----

Once the `rngd` service has started, entropy should increase to a sufficient
level.
