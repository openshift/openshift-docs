= Restoring a project

To restore a project, create the new project, then restore any exported files
by running `oc create -f pods.json`. However, restoring a project from scratch
requires a specific order because some objects depend on others. For
example, you must create the `configmaps` before you create any `pods`.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. If the project was exported as a single file, import it by running the 
following commands:
+
----
$ oc new-project <projectname>
$ oc create -f project.yaml
$ oc create -f secret.yaml
$ oc create -f serviceaccount.yaml
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml
$ oc create -f rolebindings.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Some resources, such as pods and default service accounts, can fail to be created.
====

. If you exported the project by using the `project_export.sh` script, the files
are in the `projectname` directory. You can import them by running the
`project_import.sh` script again. This script performs the `oc create` process 
in the proper order.

$ mkdir ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib.git
$ cd openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/day2ops/scripts
$ ./project_import.sh <projectname_path>

For example:

$ ls ~/backup/myproject

----

[NOTE]
====
`AlreadyExists` errors can appear because some objects, such as 
`serviceaccounts` and secrets, are created automatically when you create the 
project.
====

. Check to see if you use `buildconfigs`:
+
----
$ oc get bc
NAME      TYPE      FROM      LATEST
ruby-ex   Source    Git       1
$ oc get pods
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
guestbook-1-plnnq         1/1       Running   0          26s
hello-openshift-1-g4g0j   1/1       Running   0          26s
----
+
If you use `buildconfigs`, the builds are not triggered automatically,
and the applications do not run.

. If you use `buildconfigs`, to trigger the builds, run the `oc start-build`
command:
+
----
$ for bc in $(oc get bc -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}")
do
    oc start-build ${bc}
done
----
+
The pods deploy after the build completes.

. To verify the project was restored:
+

$ oc get all
