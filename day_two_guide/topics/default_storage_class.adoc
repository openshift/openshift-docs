Checking the default storage class

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/run_once_tasks.adoc

For proper functionality of dynamically provisioned persistent storage, the
default storage class needs to be defined. During the installation, this default
storage class is defined for common cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and more. 

To verify that the default storage class is defined:

----
$ oc get storageclass
NAME                 TYPE
ssd                  kubernetes.io/gce-pd
standard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd
----

The above output is taken from an {product-title} instance running on GCP, where
two kinds of persistent storage are available: standard (HDD) and SSD. Notice
the standard storage class is configured as the default. If there is no storage
class defined, or none is set as a default, see the
xref:../install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.adoc#install-config-persistent-storage-dynamically-provisioning-pvs[Dynamic
Provisioning and Creating Storage Classes] section for instructions on how to set up a storage class as suggested.
