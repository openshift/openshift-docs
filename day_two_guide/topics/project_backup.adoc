Project backup

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/project_level_tasks.adoc
////

Creating a backup of all relevant data involves exporting all important
information, then restoring into a new project.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, a {product-title} project back up and restore tool is being developed
by Red Hat. See the following bug for more information:

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1303205[bugzilla 1303205].

. Export the project objects into a `project.yaml` file in `yaml` format:
+
----
$ oc export all -o yaml > project.yaml
----
+
Or, in `json`:
+
----
$ oc export all -o json > project.json
----

. The above creates a `yaml` or `json` file with the project content. This,
however, does not export all objects, such as `role bindings`, `secrets`,
`service accounts`, or `persistent volume claims`. To export these, run:
+
----
$ for object in rolebindings serviceaccounts secrets imagestreamtags podpreset cms egressnetworkpolicies rolebindingrestrictions limitranges resourcequotas pvcs templates cronjobs statefulsets hpas deployments replicasets poddisruptionbudget endpoints
do
  oc export $object -o yaml > $object.yaml
done
----

. Some exported objects can rely on specific metadata or references to unique
IDs in the project. This is a limitation on the usability of the recreated
objects.
+
When using `imagestreams`, the `image` parameter of a `deploymentconfig` can
point to a specific `sha` checksum of an image in the internal registry that
would not exist in a restored environment. For instance, running the sample
"ruby-ex" as `oc new-app
centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git` creates an
`imagestream` `ruby-ex` using the internal registry to host the image:
+
----
$ oc get dc ruby-ex -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[].image}"
10.111.255.221:5000/myproject/ruby-ex@sha256:880c720b23c8d15a53b01db52f7abdcbb2280e03f686a5c8edfef1a2a7b21cee
----
+
If importing the `deploymentconfig` as it is exported with `oc export` it fails
if the image does not exist.
+
To create those exports, use the `project_export.sh` in the
`openshift-ansible-contrib` repository, which creates all the project objects in
different files. The script creates a directory on the host running the script
with the project name and a `json` file for every object type in that project.
+
[NOTE]
====
The code in the `openshift-ansible-contrib` repository referenced below
is not explicitly supported by Red Hat but the Reference Architecture team
performs testing to ensure the code operates as defined and is secure.

The script runs on Linux and requires `jq` and the `oc` commands installed and
the system should be logged in to the {product-title} environment as a user that
can read all the objects in that project.

$ less bcs.json
...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Some files can be empty if the objects does not exist when the export is
executed.
====

. If using `imagestreams`, the script modifies the `deploymentconfig` to use the
image reference instead the image `sha`, creating a different `json` file than
the exported using the `_patched` appendix:
+
----
$ diff dc_hello-openshift.json dc_hello-openshift_patched.json
45c45
<             "image": "docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift@sha256:42b59c869471a1b5fdacadf778667cecbaa79e002b7235f8091540ae612f0e14",
---
>             "image": "hello-openshift:latest",
----

[WARNING]
====
The script does not support multiple container pods currently, use it
with caution.
====

=== Restore Project

To restore a project, create the new project, then restore any exported files
with `oc create -f pods.json`. However, restoring a project from scratch
requires a specific order, because some objects are dependent on others. For
example, the `configmaps` must be created before any `pods`.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. If the project has been exported as a single file, it can be imported as:
+
----
$ oc new-project <projectname>
$ oc create -f project.yaml
$ oc create -f secret.yaml
$ oc create -f serviceaccount.yaml
$ oc create -f pvc.yaml
$ oc create -f rolebindings.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Some resources can fail to be created (for example, pods and default
service accounts).
====

. If the project was initially exported using the `project_export.sh` script,
the files are located in the `projectname` directory, and can be imported using
the same `project_import.sh` script that performs the `oc create` process in the
proper order:
+
----
$ mkdir ~/git
$ cd ~/git
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible-contrib.git
$ cd openshift-ansible-contrib/reference-architecture/day2ops/scripts
$ ./project_import.sh <projectname_path>

`AlreadyExists` errors can appear, because some objects as `serviceaccounts` and
secrets are created automatically when creating the project.

and the applications are not executed:

$ for bc in $(oc get bc -o jsonpath="{.items[*].metadata.name}")
