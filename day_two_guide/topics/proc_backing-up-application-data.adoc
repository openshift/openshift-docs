= Backing up application data

In many cases, you can back up application data by using the `oc rsync` command,
assuming `rsync` is installed within the container image. The Red Hat *rhel7*
base image contains `rsync`. Therefore, all images that are based on *rhel7*
contain it as well. See 
xref:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.adoc#cli-operations-rsync[Troubleshooting and Debugging CLI Operations - rsync].

[WARNING]
====
This is a _generic_ backup of application data and does not take into account
application-specific backup procedures, for example, special export and import
procedures for database systems.
====

Other means of backup might exist depending on the type of the persistent volume
you use, for example, Cinder, NFS, or Gluster.

The paths to back up are also _application specific_. You can determine
what path to back up by looking at the `*mountPath*` for volumes in the
`*deploymentconfig*`.

[NOTE]
====
You can perform this type of application data backup only while the application
pod is running.

== Procedure

.Example of backing up a Jenkins deployment's application data

. Get the application data `*mountPath*` from the `*deploymentconfig*`:
+
----
$ oc get dc/jenkins -o jsonpath='{ .spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=="jenkins")].volumeMounts[?(@.name=="jenkins-data")].mountPath }'
/var/lib/jenkins
----

. Get the name of the pod that is currently running:
+
----
$ oc get pod --selector=deploymentconfig=jenkins -o jsonpath='{ .metadata.name }'
jenkins-1-37nux
----

. Use the `oc rsync` command to copy application data:
+
----
$ oc rsync jenkins-1-37nux:/var/lib/jenkins /tmp/
