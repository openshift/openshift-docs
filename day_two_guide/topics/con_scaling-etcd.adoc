= Scaling etcd

You can scale the etcd cluster vertically by adding more resources to the etcd
hosts or horizontally by adding more etcd hosts.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the voting system etcd uses, the cluster must always contain an odd
number of members.

Having a cluster with an odd number of etcd hosts can account for fault
tolerance. Having an odd number of etcd hosts does not change the number needed
for a quorum but increases the tolerance for failure. For example, with a 
cluster of three members, quorum is two, which leaves a failure tolerance of
one. This ensures the cluster continues to operate if two of the members are
healthy.

Having an in-production cluster of three etcd hosts is recommended.
====

The new host requires a fresh Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7 dedicated host.
The etcd storage should be located on an SSD disk to achieve maximum performance
and on a dedicated disk mounted in `/var/lib/etcd`.

== Prerequisites

. Before you add a new etcd host,
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_backup.adoc#backing-up-etcd_environment-backup[perform a backup of both etcd 
configuration and data] to prevent data loss.

. Check the current etcd cluster status to avoid adding new hosts to an
unhealthy cluster.
** If you use the v2 etcd api, run this command:
+
----
# etcdctl --cert-file=/etc/etcd/peer.crt \
          --key-file=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --ca-file=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \
          --peers="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
          https://*master-2.example.com*:2379"\
          cluster-health
member 5ee217d19001 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.12:2379
member 2a529ba1840722c0 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.8:2379
member ed4f0efd277d7599 is healthy: got healthy result from https://192.168.55.13:2379
cluster is healthy
----
** If you use the v3 etcd api, run this command:
+
----
# ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cert="/etc/etcd/peer.crt" \
          --key=/etc/etcd/peer.key \
          --cacert="/etc/etcd/ca.crt" \
          --endpoints="https://*master-0.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-1.example.com*:2379,\
            https://*master-2.example.com*:2379"
            endpoint health
https://master-0.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 5.011358ms
https://master-1.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.305173ms
https://master-2.example.com:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.388772ms
----

. Before running the `scaleup` playbook, ensure the new host is registered to
the proper Red Hat software channels:
+
----
# subscription-manager register \
    --username=*<username>* --password=*<password>*
# subscription-manager attach --pool=*<poolid>*
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms \
    --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
+
etcd is hosted in the `rhel-7-server-extras-rpms` software channel.
. Upgrade etcd and iptables on the current etcd nodes:
+
----
# yum update etcd iptables-services
----
. Back up the */etc/etcd* configuration for the etcd hosts.
. If the new etcd members will also be {product-title} nodes,
xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#install-config-adding-hosts-to-cluster[add
the desired number of hosts to the cluster].
. The rest of this procedure assumes you added one host, but if you add 
multiple hosts, perform all steps on each host.
