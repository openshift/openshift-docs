Module included in the following assemblies:

Docker Storage can be backed by one of two options. The first is a thin pool
logical volume with device mapper, the second, since Red Hat Enterprise Linux
version 7.4, is an overlay2 file system. The overlay2 file system is generally
recommended due to the ease of setup and increased performance.

The Docker storage disk is mounted as `/var/lib/docker` and formatted with `xfs`
file system. Docker storage is configured to use overlay2 filesystem:

----
$ cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS='--storage-driver overlay2'
----

To verify this storage driver is used by Docker:
