NTP Synchronization

Module included in the following assemblies:

NTP (Network Time Protocol) is for keeping hosts in sync with the world clock.
Time synchronization is important for time sensitive operations, such as log
keeping and time stamps, and is highly recommended for Kubernetes, which
{product-title} is built on. {product-title} operations include etcd leader
election, health checks for pods and some other issues, and helps prevent time
skew problems.

Depending on your instance, NTP might not be enabled by default. To verify that
a host is configured to use NTP:

----
$ timedatectl
      Local time: Thu 2017-12-21 14:58:34 UTC
  Universal time: Thu 2017-12-21 14:58:34 UTC
        RTC time: Thu 2017-12-21 14:58:34
       Time zone: Etc/UTC (UTC, +0000)
     NTP enabled: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
      DST active: n/a
----

If both `NTP enabled` and `NTP synchronized` are `yes`, then NTP synchronization
is active.

If `no`, install and enable the `ntp` or `chrony` RPM package.

For NTP:

----
# timedatectl set-ntp true
----

For chrony:

----
# yum install chrony
# systemctl enable chronyd --now
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Time synchronization should be enabled on all hosts in the cluster, whether using NTP or any other method.
