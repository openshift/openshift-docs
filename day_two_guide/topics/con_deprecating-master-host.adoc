= Deprecating a master host

Deprecating a master host removes it from the {product-title} environment.

The reasons to deprecate or scale down master hosts include hardware re-sizing
or replacing the underlying infrastructure.

Highly available {product-title} environments require at least three master
hosts and three etcd nodes. Usually, the master hosts are colocated with the
etcd services. If you deprecate a master host, you must also deprecate the
etcd service on that host.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the master and etcd services are always deployed in odd numbers due
to the voting mechanisms that take place among those services.
