Managing Docker certificates

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/docker_tasks.adoc
////

An {product-title} internal registry is created as a pod. However, containers
may be pulled from external registries if desired. By default, registries listen
on TCP port 5000. Registries provide the option of securing exposed images via
TLS or running a registry without encrypting traffic.

[WARNING]
====
Docker interprets `.crt` files as CA certificates and `.cert` files as
client certificates. Any CA extensions *must* be `.crt`.

==== Installing a certificate authority certificate for external registries

In order to use {product-title} with an external registry, the registry
certificate authority (CA) certificate must be trusted for all the nodes that
can pull images from the registry.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the Docker version, the process to trust a Docker registry
varies. The latest versions of Docker's root certificate authorities are merged
with system defaults. Prior to `docker` version 1.13, the system default
certificate is used only when no other custom root certificates exist.
====

=== Procedure

. Copy the CA certificate to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`:
+
----
$ sudo cp myregistry.example.com.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
----

. Extract and add the CA certificate to the list of trusted certificates
authorities:
+
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust extract
----

. Verify the SSL certificate using the `openssl` command:
+
----
$ openssl verify myregistry.example.com.crt
myregistry.example.com.crt: OK
----

. Once the certificate is in place and the trust is updated, restart the
`docker` service to ensure the new certificates are properly set:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----

For Docker versions prior to 1.13, perform the following additional steps for
trusting certificates of authority:

. On every node create a new directory in `/etc/docker/certs.d` where the
name of the directory is the host name of the Docker registry:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.example.com
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The port number is not required unless the Docker registry cannot be
accessed without a port number. Addressing the port to the original Docker
registry is as follows: `myregistry.example.com:port`
====

. Accessing the Docker registry via IP address requires the creation of a new
directory within `/etc/docker/certs.d` on every node where the name of the
directory is the IP of the Docker registry:
+
----
$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/10.10.10.10
----

. Copy the CA certificate to the newly created Docker directories from the
previous steps:
+
----
$ sudo cp myregistry.example.com.crt \    
  /etc/docker/certs.d/myregistry.example.com/ca.crt

$ sudo cp myregistry.example.com.crt /etc/docker/certs.d/10.10.10.10/ca.crt
----

. Once the certificates have been copied, restart the `docker` service to
ensure the new certificates are used:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----

==== Docker certificates backup

When performing a node host backup, ensure to include the certificates for
external registries.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. If using `/etc/docker/certs.d`, copy all the certificates included in the
directory and store the files:
+
----
$ sudo tar -czvf docker-registry-certs-$(hostname)-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /etc/docker/certs.d/
----

. If using a system trust, store the certificates prior to adding them within
the system trust. Once the store is complete, extract the certificate for
restoration using the `trust` command. Identify the system trust CAs and note
the `pkcs11` ID:
+
----
$ trust list
...[OUTPUT OMMITED]...
pkcs11:id=%a5%b3%e1%2b%2b%49%b6%d7%73%a1%aa%94%f5%01%e7%73%65%4c%ac%50;type=cert
    type: certificate
    label: MyCA
    trust: anchor
    category: authority
...[OUTPUT OMMITED]...
----

. Extract the certificate in `pem` format and provide it a name. For example, `myca.crt`.
+
----
$ trust extract --format=pem-bundle \
 --filter="%a5%b3%e1%2b%2b%49%b6%d7%73%a1%aa%94%f5%01%e7%73%65%4c%ac%50;type=cert" myca.crt
----

. Verify the certificate has been properly extracted via `openssl`:
+
----
$ openssl verify myca.crt
----

. Repeat the procedure for all the required certificates and store the files
in a remote location.

==== Docker certificates restore
In the event of the deletion or corruption of the Docker certificates for the
external registries, the restore mechanism uses the same steps as the
installation method using the files from the backups performed previously.
