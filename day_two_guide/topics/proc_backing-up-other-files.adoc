= Backing up other installation files

Back up the files that you used to install {product-title}.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Because the restoration procedure involves a complete reinstallation, save all
the files used in the initial installation. These files might
include:
+
- Ansible playbooks and inventory files from the
xref:../install/running_install.adoc#install-running-installation-playbooks[cluster
installation]
- *_/etc/yum.repos.d/ose.repo_* from the
xref:../install/disconnected_install.adoc#install-config-install-disconnected-install[disconnected
installation] method

. Backup the procedures for post-installation steps. Some installations might
involve steps that are not included in the installer. These steps might include
changes to the services outside of the control of {product-title} or the
installation of extra services like monitoring agents.
Additional configuration that is not yet supported by the advanced installer
might also be affected, such as using multiple authentication providers.
