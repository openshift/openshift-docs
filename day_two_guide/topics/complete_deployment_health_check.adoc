Checking complete environment health

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc
////

To verify the end-to-end functionality of an {product-title} cluster, build and deploy an example application.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Create a new project named `validate`, as well as an example application from the `cakephp-mysql-example` template:
+
----
$ oc new-project validate
$ oc new-app cakephp-mysql-example
----
+
You can check the logs to follow the build:
+
----
$ oc logs -f bc/cakephp-mysql-example
----

. Once the build is complete, two pods should be running: a database and an application:
+
----
$ oc get pods
NAME                            READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
cakephp-mysql-example-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          1m
cakephp-mysql-example-2-247xm   1/1       Running     0          39s
mysql-1-hbk46                   1/1       Running     0          1m
----

. Visit the application URL. The Cake PHP framework welcome page should be
visible. The URL should have the following format
`cakephp-mysql-example-validate.<app_domain>`.

. Once the functionality has been verified, the `validate` project can be
deleted:
+
----
$ oc delete project validate
----
+
All resources within the project will be deleted as well.
