Deprecating a Master Host

Module included in the following assemblies:

Deprecating a master host removes it from the {product-title} environment.

The reasons to deprecate or scale down master hosts include hardware re-sizing
or replacing the underlying infrastructure.

Highly available {product-title} environments require at least three master
hosts and three etcd nodes. Usually, the master hosts are collocated with the
etcd services. This topic describes the deprecation process for master hosts
with or without collocated etcd.

You should create a backup of the configuration and data files prior to any
important task such as deprecating a master host. See the
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-master-backup[Creating
a master host backup] and
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-etcd-backup[etcd
tasks] sections for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the master and etcd services are always deployed in odd numbers due
to the voting mechanisms that take place among those services.

==== Deprecating a master host without collocated etcd

Master hosts run important services, such as the {product-title} API and
controllers services (if multiple masters are present). In order to deprecate a
master host, these services must be stopped. 

The {product-title} API service is an active/active service, so stopping the
service does not affect the environment as long as the requests are sent to a
separate master server. However, the {product-title} controllers service is an
active/passive service, where the services leverage etcd to decide the active
master. 

////
In order to check the master running the active controller service, see
xref:../day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc#day-two-guide-controller-role-verification[Controller
role verification].

Deprecating a master host in a multi-master architecture includes removing the
master from the load balancer pool to avoid new connections attempting to use
that master. This process depends heavily on the load balancer used. The steps
below show the details of removing the master from `haproxy`. In the event that
{product-title} is running on a cloud provider, or using a `F5` appliance, see
the specific product documents to remove the master from rotation.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Remove the `backend` section in the `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` configuration
file. For example, if deprecating a master named `master-0.example.com` using
`haproxy`, ensure the host name is removed from the following:
+
----
backend mgmt8443
    balance source
    mode tcp
    # MASTERS 8443
    server master-1.example.com 192.168.55.12:8443 check
    server master-2.example.com 192.168.55.13:8443 check
----

. Then, restart the `haproxy` service.
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart haproxy
----

. Once the master is removed from the load balancer, disable the API and
controller services:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl disable --now atomic-openshift-master-api
$ sudo systemctl disable --now atomic-openshift-master-controllers
----

. Because the master host is a unschedulable {product-title} node, follow the
steps in the
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-deprecating-node[Deprecating
a node host] section.

. Remove the master host from the `[masters]` and `[nodes]` groups in the
`/etc/ansible/hosts` Ansible inventory file to avoid issues if running any
Ansible tasks using that inventory file:
+
----
...[OUTPUT OMITTED]...
# host group for masters
[masters]
*master-0.example.com*
master-1.example.com
master-2.example.com

# host group for nodes, includes region info
[nodes]
*master-0.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'role': 'master'}" openshift_hostname=master-0.example.com openshift_schedulable=false*
...[OUTPUT OMITTED]...
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Deprecating the first master host listed in the Ansible inventory file requires
extra precautions. 

At the time of writing, the `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt` file is
generated onto only the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory.
This is being investigated to be fixed in future {product-title} releases in the
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1469358[1469358 bugzilla]. If
deprecating the first master host, copy the `/etc/origin/master/ca.serial.txt`
file to the rest of master hosts before the process.
====

. The `kubernetes` service includes the master host IPs as endpoints. To
verify that the master has been properly deprecated, review the `kubernetes`
service output and see if the deprecated master has been removed:
+
----
$ oc describe svc kubernetes -n default
Name:			kubernetes
Namespace:		default
Labels:			component=apiserver
			provider=kubernetes
Annotations:		<none>
Selector:		<none>
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			10.111.0.1
Port:			https	443/TCP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8443,192.168.55.13:8443
Port:			dns	53/UDP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8053,192.168.55.13:8053
Port:			dns-tcp	53/TCP
Endpoints:		192.168.55.12:8053,192.168.55.13:8053
Session Affinity:	ClientIP
Events:			<none>
----
+
Once the master has been successfully deprecated, the host where the master
was previously running can be safely deleted.

==== Deprecating master host with collocated etcd

To deprecate a master host running an etcd service, execute the previous steps
in
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-host-tasks-deprecating-master-without-etcd[Deprecating
a master host without collocated etcd], as well as the steps in
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#removing-an-etcd-host[Removing an
etcd host].

[[day-two-guide-replacing-master]]
==== Replacing a master host

In the event of replacing a broken master host, follow the process in
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-host-tasks-deprecating-master-without-etcd[Deprecating
a master host without collocated etcd], then scale up the master hosts using the scale up Ansible playbook following the steps in
xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#install-config-adding-hosts-to-cluster[Adding hosts to an
existing cluster].

If the master host has a collocated etcd, use the
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#deprecating-a-collocated-etcd-master-host[Deprecating
master host with collocated etcd] steps, then the
xref:../install_config/adding_hosts_to_existing_cluster.adoc#install-config-adding-hosts-to-cluster[Adding hosts to an
existing cluster] as well as
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#scaling-etcd[Scaling etcd].
