Verifying correct Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc
////

Verifying the maximum transmission unit (MTU) prevents a possible networking
misconfiguration that can masquerade as an SSL certificate issue.

When a packet is larger than the MTU size that is transmitted over HTTP, the
physical network router is able to break the packet into multiple packets to
transmit the data. However, when a packet is larger than the MTU size is that
transmitted over HTTPS, the router is forced to drop the packet.

Installation produces certificates that
provide secure connections to multiple components that include:

* master hosts
* node hosts
* infrastructure nodes
* registry
* router

These certificates can be found within the `/etc/origin/master` directory for
the master nodes and `/etc/origin/node` directory for the infra and app nodes.

After installation, you can verify connectivity to the
`REGISTRY_OPENSHIFT_SERVER_ADDR` using the process outlined in the
xref:../environment_health.adoc#day-two-guide-network-connectivity[Network
connectivity] section.

=== Prerequisites

. From a master host, get the HTTPS address:
+
----
$ oc get dc docker-registry -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[].env[?(@.name=="OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY")].value}{"\n"}'
docker-registry.default.svc:5000
----
+
The above gives the output of `docker-registry.default.svc:5000`.

. Append `/healthz` to the value given above, use it to check on all hosts
(master, infrastructure, node):
+
----
$ curl -v https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000/healthz
* About to connect() to docker-registry.default.svc port 5000 (#0)
*   Trying 172.30.11.171...
* Connected to docker-registry.default.svc (172.30.11.171) port 5000 (#0)
* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
*   CAfile: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
  CApath: none
* SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
* Server certificate:
* 	subject: CN=172.30.11.171
* 	start date: Oct 18 05:30:10 2017 GMT
* 	expire date: Oct 18 05:30:11 2019 GMT
* 	common name: 172.30.11.171
* 	issuer: CN=openshift-signer@1508303629
> GET /healthz HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0
> Host: docker-registry.default.svc:5000
> Accept: */*

* Connection #0 to host docker-registry.default.svc left intact
----
+
The above example output shows the MTU size being used to ensure the SSL
connection is correct. The attempt to connect is successful, followed by
connectivity being established and completes with initializing the NSS with the
certpath and all the server certificate information regarding the
_docker-registry_.
+
An improper MTU size results in a timeout:
+
----
$ curl -v https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000/healthz
* About to connect() to docker-registry.default.svc port 5000 (#0)
*   Trying 172.30.11.171...
* Connected to docker-registry.default.svc (172.30.11.171) port 5000 (#0)
* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
----
+
The above example shows that the connection is established, but it cannot finish
initializing NSS with certpath. The issue deals with improper MTU size set
within the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file.
+
To fix this issue, adjust the MTU size within the
`/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` to 50 bytes smaller than the MTU size being
used by the OpenShift SDN Ethernet device.

. View the MTU size of the desired Ethernet device (i.e. `eth0`):
+
----
$ ip link show eth0
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP mode DEFAULT qlen 1000
    link/ether fa:16:3e:92:6a:86 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
----
+
The above shows MTU set to 1500.

. To change the MTU size, modify the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file
and set a value that is 50 bytes smaller than output provided by the `ip` command.
+
For example, if the MTU size is set to 1500, adjust the MTU size to 1450 within
the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file:
+
[source, yaml]
----
networkConfig:
   mtu: 1450
----

. Save the changes and reboot the node:
+
[NOTE]
====
You must change the MTU size on all masters and nodes that are part of the
{product-title} SDN. Also, the MTU size of the tun0 interface must be the same
across all nodes that are part of the cluster.
====

. Once the node is back online, confirm the issue no longer exists by re-running
the original `curl` command. 
+
----
$ curl -v https://docker-registry.default.svc:5000/healthz
----
+
If the timeout persists, continue to adjust the MTU size in increments of 50
bytes and repeat the process.
