= Restoring a master host backup

After creating a backup of important master host files, if they become corrupted
or accidentally removed, you can restore the files by copying the files back to
master, ensuring they contain the proper content, and restarting the
affected services.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Restore the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:
+
----
# MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
# cp /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml.old
# cp /backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)/origin/master/master-config.yaml /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Restarting the master services can lead to downtime. However, you can remove the
master host from the highly available load balancer pool, then perform the
restore operation. Once the service has been properly restored, you can add the
master host back to the load balancer pool.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Perform a full reboot of the affected instance to restore the `iptables`
configuration.
====

. If you cannot restart {product-title} because packages are missing, reinstall
the packages.

.. Get the list of the current installed packages:
+
----
$ rpm -qa | sort > /tmp/current_packages.txt
----

.. View the differences between the package lists:
+
----
$ diff /tmp/current_packages.txt ${MYBACKUPDIR}/packages.txt

> ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch
----

.. Reinstall the missing packages:
+
----
# yum reinstall -y <packages> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<packages>` with the packages that are different between the
package lists.

. Restore a system certificate by copying the certificate to the
`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` directory and execute the `update-ca-trust`:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
$ sudo cp ${MYBACKUPDIR}/external_certificates/my_company.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Always ensure the user ID and group ID are restored when the files are copied
back, as well as the `SELinux` context.
