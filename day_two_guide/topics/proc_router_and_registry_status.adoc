Router and registry health

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/environment_health_checks.adoc
////

To check if a router service is running:

----
$ oc -n default get deploymentconfigs/router
NAME      REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
router    1          3         3         config
----

The values in the `DESIRED` and `CURRENT` columns should match the number of
nodes hosts.

Use the same command to check the registry status:

----
$ oc -n default get deploymentconfigs/docker-registry
NAME              REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
docker-registry   1          3         3         config
----

[NOTE]
==== 
Multiple running instances of the container registry require backend storage
supporting writes by multiple processes. If the chosen infrastructure provider
does not contain this ability, running a single instance of a container registry
is acceptable.
====

To verify that all pods are running and on which hosts:

----
$ oc -n default get pods -o wide
NAME                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP            NODE

If {product-title} is using an external container registry, the internal
registry service does not need to be running.
