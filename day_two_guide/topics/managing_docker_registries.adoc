Managing container registries

Module included in the following assemblies:

* day_two_guide/docker_tasks.adoc
////

You can configure {product-title} to use external `docker` registries to pull
images. However, you can use configuration files to allow or deny certain images
or registries.

If the external registry is exposed using certificates for the network traffic,
it can be named as a secure registry. Otherwise, traffic between the registry
and host is plain text and not encrypted, meaning it is an insecure registry.

== Docker search external registries

By default, the `docker` daemon has the ability to pull images from any
registry, but the search operation is performed against `docker.io/` and
`registry.redhat.io`. The daemon can be configured to search images
from other registries using the `--add-registry` option with the `docker`
daemon.

[NOTE]
====
The ability to search images from the Red Hat Registry
`registry.redhat.io` exists by default in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux
`docker` package.
====

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. To allow users to search for images using `docker search` with other
registries, add those registries to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file
under the `registries` parameter:
+
----
registries:
  - registry.redhat.io
  - my.registry.example.com
----

. Restart the `docker` daemon to allow for `my.registry.example.com` to be used:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----
+
Restarting the `docker` daemon causes the `docker` containers to restart.

. Using the Ansible installer, this can be configured using the
`openshift_docker_additional_registries` variable in the Ansible hosts file:
+
----
openshift_docker_additional_registries=registry.redhat.io,my.registry.example.com
----

== Docker external registries whitelist and blacklist

Docker can be configured to block operations from external registries by
configuring the `registries` and `block_registries` flags for the `docker`
daemon.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Add the allowed registries to the `/etc/containers/registries.conf` file with
the `registries` flag:
+
----
registries:
  - registry.redhat.io
  - my.registry.example.com
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `docker.io` registry can be added using the same method.
====

. Block the rest of the registries:
+
----
block_registries:
   - all
----

. Block the rest of the registries in older versions:
+
----
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----

. Restart the `docker` daemon:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----
+
Restarting the `docker` daemon causes the `docker` containers to restart.

. In this example, the `docker.io` registry has been blacklisted, so any operation
regarding that registry fails:
+
----
$ sudo docker pull hello-world
Using default tag: latest
Trying to pull repository registry.redhat.io/hello-world ...
Trying to pull repository my.registry.example.com/hello-world ...
Trying to pull repository registry.redhat.io/hello-world ...
unknown: Not Found
$ sudo docker pull docker.io/hello-world
Using default tag: latest
Trying to pull repository docker.io/library/hello-world ...
All endpoints blocked.
----
+
Add `docker.io` back to the `registries` variable by modifying the file again
and restarting the service.
+
----
registries:
  - registry.redhat.io
  - my.registry.example.com
  - docker.io
block_registries:
  - all
----
+
or
+
----
ADD_REGISTRY="--add-registry=registry.redhat.io --add-registry=my.registry.example.com --add-registry=docker.io"
BLOCK_REGISTRY='--block-registry=all'
----

. Restart the Docker service:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
----

. To verify that the image is now available to be pulled:
+
----
$ sudo docker pull docker.io/hello-world
Using default tag: latest
Trying to pull repository docker.io/library/hello-world ...
latest: Pulling from docker.io/library/hello-world

9a0669468bf7: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0e06ef5e1945a718b02a8c319e15bae44f47039005530bc617a5d071190ed3fc
----

. If using an external registry is required, for example to modify the `docker`
daemon configuration file in all the node hosts that require to use that
registry, create a blacklist on those nodes to avoid malicious containers from
being executed.
+
Using the Ansible installer, this can be configured using the
`openshift_docker_additional_registries` and
`openshift_docker_blocked_registries` variables in the Ansible hosts file:
+
----
openshift_docker_additional_registries=registry.redhat.io,my.registry.example.com
openshift_docker_blocked_registries=all
----

== Secure registries

In order to be able to pull images from an external registry, it is required
to trust the registry certificates, otherwise the pull image operation fails.

In order to do so, see the xref:../day_two_guide/docker_tasks.adoc#day-two-managing-docker-certs-installing-a-cert-authority[Installing a Certificate Authority Certificate for External Registries] section.

If using a whitelist, the external registries should be added to the
`registries` variable, as explained above.


== Insecure registries

External registries that use non-trusted certificates, or without certificates
at all, should be avoided.

However, any insecure registries should be added using the `--insecure-registry`
option to allow for the `docker` daemon to pull images from the repository. This
is the same as the `--add-registry` option, but the `docker` operation is not
verified.

The registry should be added using both options to enable search, and, if there
is a blacklist, to perform other operations, such as pulling images.

For testing purposes, an example is shown on how to add a `localhost` insecure
registry.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Modify `/etc/containers/registries.conf` configuration file to add the
localhost insecure registry:
+
----
registries:
  - registry.redhat.io
  - my.registry.example.com
  - docker.io
insecure_registries:
  - localhost:5000
block_registries:
  - all
----

. Restart the `docker` daemon to use the registry:
+
----
$ sudo systemctl restart docker.service
----
+
Restarting the `docker` daemon causes the `docker` containers to be restarted.

. Run a container image registry pod at `localhost`:
+
----
$ sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 registry:2
----

. Pull an image:
+
----
$ sudo docker pull openshift/hello-openshift
----

. Tag the image:
+
----
$ sudo docker tag docker.io/openshift/hello-openshift:latest localhost:5000/hello-openshift-local:latest
----

. Push the image to the local registry:
+
----
$ sudo docker push localhost:5000/hello-openshift-local:latest
----

. Using the Ansible installer, this can be configured using the
`openshift_docker_additional_registries`, `openshift_docker_blocked_registries`,
and `openshift_docker_insecure_registries` variables in the `Ansible` hosts
file:
+
----
openshift_docker_additional_registries=registry.redhat.io,my.registry.example.com,localhost:5000
openshift_docker_insecure_registries=localhost:5000
openshift_docker_blocked_registries=all
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also set the `openshift_docker_insecure_registries` variable to the IP
address of the host. `0.0.0.0/0` is not a valid setting.
====

== Authenticated registries

Using authenticated registries with `docker` requires the `docker` daemon to log
in to the registry. With {product-title}, a different set of steps must be
performed, because the users can not run `docker login` commands on the host.
Authenticated registries can be used to limit the images users can pull or who
can access the external registries.

If an external `docker` registry requires authentication, create a special
secret in the project that uses that registry and then use that secret to
perform the `docker` operations.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Create a `dockercfg` secret in the project where the user is going to log in
to the `docker` registry:
+
----
$ oc project <my_project>
$ oc create secret docker-registry <my_registry> --docker-server=<my.registry.example.com> --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<my_password> --docker-email=<me@example.com>
----

. If a `.dockercfg` file exists, create the secret using the `oc` command:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic <my_registry> --from-file=.dockercfg=<path/to/.dockercfg> --type=kubernetes.io/dockercfg
----

. Populate the `$HOME/.docker/config.json` file:
+
----
$ oc create secret generic <my_registry> --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.dockercfg> --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
----

. Use the `dockercfg` secret to pull images from the authenticated registry by
linking the secret to the service account performing the pull operations. The
default service account to pull images is named `default`:
+
----
$ oc secrets link default <my_registry> --for=pull
----

. For pushing images using the S2I feature, the `dockercfg` secret is mounted
in the S2I pod, so it needs to be linked to the proper service account that
performs the build. The default service account used to build images is named
`builder`.
+
----
$ oc secrets link builder <my_registry>
----

. In the `buildconfig`, the secret should be specified for push or pull
operations:
+
----
"type": "Source",
"sourceStrategy": {
    "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "*my.registry.example.com*/myproject/myimage:stable"
    },
    "pullSecret": {
        "name": "*mydockerregistry*"
    },
...[OUTPUT ABBREVIATED]...
"output": {
    "to": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "*my.registry.example.com*/myproject/myimage:latest"
    },
    "pushSecret": {
        "name": "*mydockerregistry*"
    },
...[OUTPUT ABBREVIATED]...
----

. If the external registry delegates authentication to external services, create
both `dockercfg` secrets: the registry one using the registry URL and the
external authentication system using its own URL. Both secrets should be added
to the service accounts.
+
----
$ oc project <my_project>
$ oc create secret docker-registry <my_registry> --docker-server=*<my_registry_example.com> --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<my_password> --docker-email=<me@example.com>
$ oc create secret docker-registry <my_docker_registry_ext_auth> --docker-server=<my.authsystem.example.com> --docker-username=<username> --docker-password=<my_password> --docker-email=<me@example.com>
$ oc secrets link default <my_registry> --for=pull
$ oc secrets link default <my_docker_registry_ext_auth> --for=pull
$ oc secrets link builder <my_registry>
$ oc secrets link builder <my_docker_registry_ext_auth>
----

== ImagePolicy admission plug-in

An admission control plug-in intercepts requests to the API, and performs checks
depending on the configured rules and allows or denies certain actions
based on those rules. {product-title} can limit the allowed images running in
the environment
xref:../admin_guide/image_policy.adoc#admin-guide-image-policy[using the
`ImagePolicy` admission plug-in] where it can control:

* The source of images: which registries can be used to pull images
* Image resolution: force pods to run with immutable digests to ensure the
image does not change due to a re-tag
* Container image label restrictions: force an image to have or not have
particular labels
* Image annotation restrictions: force an image in the integrated container
registry to have or not have particular annotations

[WARNING]
====
`ImagePolicy` admission plug-in is currently considered beta.
====

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. If the `ImagePolicy` plug-in is enabled, it needs to be modified to allow the
external registries to be used by modifying the
`/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file on every master node:
+
----
admissionConfig:
  pluginConfig:
    openshift.io/ImagePolicy:
      configuration:
        kind: ImagePolicyConfig
        apiVersion: v1
        executionRules:
        - name: allow-images-from-other-registries
          onResources:
          - resource: pods
          - resource: builds
          matchRegistries:
          - docker.io
          - <my.registry.example.com>
          - registry.redhat.io
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Enabling `ImagePolicy` requires users to specify the registry when deploying an
application like `oc new-app docker.io/kubernetes/guestbook` instead `oc new-app
kubernetes/guestbook`, otherwise it fails.
====

. To enable the admission plug-ins at installation time, the
`openshift_master_admission_plugin_config` variable can be used with a `json`
formatted string including all the `pluginConfig` configuration:
+
----
openshift_master_admission_plugin_config={"openshift.io/ImagePolicy":{"configuration":{"kind":"ImagePolicyConfig","apiVersion":"v1","executionRules":[{"name":"allow-images-from-other-registries","onResources":[{"resource":"pods"},{"resource":"builds"}],"matchRegistries":["docker.io","*my.registry.example.com*","registry.redhat.io"]}]}}}
----

== Import images from external registries

Application developers can import images to create `imagestreams` using the `oc
import-image` command, and {product-title} can be configured to allow or deny
image imports from external registries.

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. To configure the allowed registries where users can import images, add the
following to the `/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml` file:
+
----
imagePolicyConfig:
  allowedRegistriesForImport:
  - domainName: docker.io
  - domainName: '\*.docker.io'
  - domainName: '*.redhat.com'
  - domainName: 'my.registry.example.com'
----

. To import images from an external authenticated registry, create a secret within the desired project.

. Even if not recommended, if the external authenticated registry is insecure or
the certificates can not be trusted, the `oc import-image` command can be used
with the `--insecure=true` option.
+
If the external authenticated registry is secure, the registry certificate
should be trusted in the master hosts as they run the registry import
controller as:
+
Copy the certificate in the `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/`:
+
----
$ sudo cp <my.registry.example.com.crt> /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/<my.registry.example.com.crt>
----

. Run `update-ca-trust` command:
+
----
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----

. Restart the master services on all the master hosts:
+
----
$ sudo master-restart api
$ sudo master-restart controllers
----

. The certificate for the external registry should be trusted in the
{product-title} registry:
+
----
$ for i in pem openssl java; do
  oc create configmap ca-trust-extracted-${i} --from-file /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/${i}
  oc set volume dc/docker-registry --add -m /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/${i} --configmap-name=ca-trust-extracted-${i} --name ca-trust-extracted-${i}
done
----
+
[WARNING]
====
There is no official procedure currently for adding the certificate to the
registry pod, but the above workaround can be used.

This workaround creates `configmaps` with all the trusted certificates
from the system running those commands, so the recommendation is to run it from
a clean system where just the required certificates are trusted.
====

. Alternatively, modify the registry image in order to trust the proper
certificates rebuilding the image using a `Dockerfile` as:
+
----
FROM registry.redhat.io/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:v3.6
ADD <my.registry.example.com.crt> /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
USER 0
RUN update-ca-trust extract
USER 1001
----

. Rebuild the image, push it to a `docker` registry, and use that image as
`spec.template.spec.containers["name":"registry"].image` in the registry
`deploymentconfig`:
+
----
$ oc patch dc docker-registry -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"registry","image":"*myregistry.example.com/openshift3/ose-docker-registry:latest*"}]}}}}'

----

[NOTE]
====
To add the `imagePolicyConfig` configuration at installation, the
`openshift_master_image_policy_config` variable can be used with a `json`
formatted string including all the `imagePolicyConfig` configuration, like:

----
openshift_master_image_policy_config={"imagePolicyConfig":{"allowedRegistriesForImport":[{"domainName":"docker.io"},{"domainName":"\*.docker.io"},{"domainName":"*.redhat.com"},{"domainName":"*my.registry.example.com*"}]}}
----
====

For more information about the `ImagePolicy`, see the xref:../admin_guide/image_policy.adoc#admin-guide-image-policy[`ImagePolicy` admission plug-in] section.

== {product-title} registry integration

You can install {product-title} as a stand-alone container image registry to provide
only the registry capabilities, but with the advantages of running in an
{product-title} platform.

For more information about the {product-title} registry, see xref:../install/stand_alone_registry.adoc#install-config-installing-stand-alone-registry[Installing a Stand-alone Deployment of OpenShift Container Registry].

To integrate the {product-title} registry, all previous sections apply. From the
{product-title} point of view, it is treated as an external registry, but there
are some extra tasks that need to be performed, because it is a multi-tenant
registry and the authorization model from {product-title} applies so when a new
project is created, the registry does not create a project within its environment
as it is independent.

=== Connect the registry project with the cluster

As the registry is a full {product-title} environment with a registry pod and a
web interface, the process to create a new project in the registry is performed
using the `oc new-project` or `oc create` command line or via the web interface.

Once the project has been created, the usual service accounts (`builder`,
`default`, and `deployer`) are created automatically, as well as the project
administrator user is granted permissions. Different users can be authorized to
push/pull images as well as "anonymous" users.

There can be several use cases, such as allowing all the users to pull images
from this new project within the registry, but if you want to have a 1:1 project
relationship between {product-title} and the registry, where the users can push
and pull images from that specific project, some steps are required.

[WARNING]
====
The registry web console shows a token to be used for pull/push operations, but
the token showed there is a session token, so it expires. Creating a service
account with specific permissions allows the administrator to limit the
permissions for the service account, so that, for example, different service
accounts can be used for push or pull images. Then, a user does not have to
configure for token expiration, secret recreation, and other tasks, as the
service account tokens will not expire.
====

[discrete]
=== Procedure

. Create a new project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <my_project>
----

. Create a registry project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <registry_project>
----

. Create a service account in the registry project:
+
----
$ oc create serviceaccount <my_serviceaccount> -n <registry_project>
----

. Give permissions to push and pull images using the `registry-editor` role:
+
----
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-user registry-editor -z <my_serviceaccount> -n <registry_project>
----
+
If only pull permissions are required, the `registry-viewer` role can be
used.

. Get the service account token:
+
----
$ TOKEN=$(oc sa get-token <my_serviceaccount> -n <registry_project>)
----

. Use the token as the password to create a `dockercfg` secret:
+
----
$ oc create secret docker-registry <my_registry> \
  --docker-server=<myregistry.example.com> --docker-username=<notused> --docker-password=${TOKEN} --docker-email=<me@example.com>
----

. Use the `dockercfg` secret to pull images from the registry by linking the
secret to the service account performing the pull operations. The default
service account to pull images is named `default`:
+
----
$ oc secrets link default <my_registry> --for=pull
----

. For pushing images using the S2I feature, the `dockercfg` secret is mounted in
the S2I pod, so it needs to be linked to the proper service account that
performs the build. The default service account used to build images is named
`builder`:
+
----
$ oc secrets link builder <my_registry>
----

. In the `buildconfig`, the secret should be specified for push or pull
operations:
+
