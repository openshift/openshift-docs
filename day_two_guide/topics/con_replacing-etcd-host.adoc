= Replacing an etcd host

To replace an etcd host, scale up the etcd cluster and then remove the host. 
This process ensures that you keep quorum if you lose an etcd host during
the replacement procedure.

[WARNING]
====
The etcd cluster must maintain a quorum during the replacement operation. This
means that at least one host must be in operation at all times.

If the host replacement operation occurs while the etcd cluster maintains a
quorum, cluster operations are usually not affected. If a large amount of etcd
data must replicate, some operations might slow down.
====

[NOTE]
====
Before you start any procedure involving the etcd cluster, you must have a 
backup of the etcd data and configuration files so that you can restore the 
cluster if the procedure fails.
