= Restoring a node host backup

After creating a backup of important node host files, if they become corrupted
or accidentally removed, you can restore the file by copying back the file,
ensuring it contains the proper content and restart the affected services.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Restore the `/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml` file:
+
----
# MYBACKUPDIR=/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)
# cp /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml.old
# cp /backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)/etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml /etc/origin/node/node-config.yaml
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node
----

[WARNING]
====
Restarting the services can lead to downtime. See
xref:../day_two_guide/host_level_tasks.adoc#day-two-guide-node-maintenance[Node
maintenance], for tips on how to ease the process.
====

[NOTE]
====
Perform a full reboot of the affected instance to restore the `iptables`
configuration.
====

. If you cannot restart {product-title} because packages are missing, reinstall
the packages.

.. Get the list of the current installed packages:
+
----
$ rpm -qa | sort > /tmp/current_packages.txt
----

.. View the differences between the package lists:
+
----
$ diff /tmp/current_packages.txt ${MYBACKUPDIR}/packages.txt

> ansible-2.4.0.0-5.el7.noarch
----

.. Reinstall the missing packages:
+
----
# yum reinstall -y <packages> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<packages>` with the packages that are different between the
package lists.

. Restore a system certificate by copying the certificate to the
`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` directory and execute the `update-ca-trust`:
+
----
$ MYBACKUPDIR=*/backup/$(hostname)/$(date +%Y%m%d)*
$ sudo cp ${MYBACKUPDIR}/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/my_company.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
$ sudo update-ca-trust
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Always ensure proper user ID and group ID are restored when the files are copied
back, as well as the `SELinux` context.
