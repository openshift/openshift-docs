{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs, as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} enables stateless serverless workloads to all run on a single multi-cloud container platform with automated operations. Developers can use a single platform for hosting their microservices, legacy, and serverless applications.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

[id="serverless-getting-started-supported-configs"]
== Supported Configurations

The set of supported features, configurations, and integrations for {ServerlessProductName}, current and past versions, are available at the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4912821[Supported Configurations page].

:FeatureName: Knative Eventing
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]
// TODO: Add ==Architecture section

=== Knative Serving

=== Knative Eventing

You can create a fan out Event delivery system from an Event Source to multiple event sinks using:

* Channels and Subscriptions, or
* Brokers and Triggers

The Channel or Broker implementation manages delivery of Events to the requested sinks, through either Subscriptions or Triggers, and will buffer Events if the destination sink is unavailable.
For more information about creating an Event delivery system, see
// Add link to getting started or tutorial landing page for eventing

== Cluster administrator set-up tasks

Complete the following tasks to set up {ServerlessProductName} on an {product-title} cluster:

. Install the xref:../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#installing-openshift-serverless[{ServerlessOperatorName}] on a {product-title} cluster.
. Install the xref:../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-serving.adoc#installing-knative-serving[Knative Serving] and xref:../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-knative-eventing.adoc#installing-knative-eventing[Knative Eventing] components.
// TODO: Add advanced config install options for Kafka, or link to other docs, e.g. AMQ Streams?

You can also follow these tutorials for more advanced use cases:

* Configure xref:../serverless/installing_serverless/serverless-install-config-options.adoc#serverless-install-config-options[Advanced installation configuration options].
* Install link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_amq/7.7/html/using_amq_streams_on_openshift/overview-str[Red Hat AMQ Streams] if want to enable the use of supported Kafka backing for Knative Eventing.

// TODO: Add any additional needed config, add event source

== Getting started for developers

Complete the following tasks to get started with a basic {ServerlessProductName} deployment:

. Create a xref:../serverless/serving-creating-managing-apps.adoc#serving-creating-managing-apps[Knative Service], or application.
// TODO: Add better docs about Services, and check that this is capitalized across docs.
. Add a xref:../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[Channel].
. Add a Subscription to deliver Events from the Channel to an Event sink.
// https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/8.AddingChannelsAndSubscriptions.md#adding-channels-and-subscriptions reference; TODO: complete Subscription docs.
. Add an xref:../serverless/event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[Event Source] to your cluster. You can also add a Channel as the sink for an Event Source.
// TODO: Clean up event source docs, decide on capitalization; add link
// TODO: https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/8.AddingChannelsAndSubscriptions.md#add-an-event-source-with-channel-as-the-sink Add an Event Source with Channel as the Sink
. Add a Broker and Trigger.
// TODO: Finish broker docs for each version, update capitalization for both; https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/9.UsingBrokersAndTriggers.md#using-brokers-and-triggers reference
// Current OK for now, from OCP 4.5+ (1.8.0) MT Broker will be default, so docs need to be updated for this in another 4.5+ PR.

// You can also follow these tutorials for more advanced use cases:
// TODO: Separate Jira issues for Kafka, 1.8.0+
// * Add a Kafka Event Source
// https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/10.KafkaSource.md
// * Using a Broker and Trigger with Red Hat AMQ Streams. For more information, see
// TODO: Other PR adding details for AMQ Streams for 1.8.0, add details of this then. Reference: https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/11.BrokerTriggerWithKafka.md
// * Add a Kafka Channel and Subscription for use with Red Hat AMQ Streams.
// https://github.com/RedHatWorkshops/knative-on-ocp4/blob/master/12.KafkaChannelSubscription.md
