:FeatureName: OpenShift Serverless
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

[id="how-it-works_{context}"]
== How {ServerlessProductName} works
Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes-native APIs, as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.
For information about installing {ServerlessProductName}, see xref:../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#installing-openshift-serverless[Installing OpenShift Serverless].

{ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} enables stateful, stateless, and serverless workloads to all run on a single multi-cloud container platform with automated operations. Developers can use a single platform for hosting their microservices, legacy, and serverless applications.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source Knative project, which provides portability and consistency across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

[id="knative-eventing_{context}"]
== Knative Eventing
A developer preview version of Knative Eventing is available for use with {ServerlessProductName}. However, this is not included in the {ServerlessOperatorName} and is not currently supported as part of this Technology Preview. For more information about Knative Eventing, including installation instructions and samples, see the link:https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/index.html[Knative Eventing on {product-title}] documentation.

[id="knative-cli_{context}"]
== Knative CLI
The Knative CLI (`kn`) extends the functionality of the `oc` or `kubectl` tools to enable interaction with Knative components on {product-title}. `kn` allows developers to deploy and manage applications without editing YAML files directly.

[id="applications_{context}"]
== Applications on {ServerlessProductName}
Applications are created using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and associated controllers in Kubernetes, and are packaged as OCI compliant Linux containers that can be run anywhere.

To deploy applications in {ServerlessProductName}, you must create Knative Services. For more information see xref:../serverless/knative_serving/getting-started-knative-services.adoc#getting-started-knative-services[Getting started with Knative Services].
