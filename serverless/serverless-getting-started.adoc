{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by minimizing the need for infrastructure set up by developers.
It provides configurable components that can be used with familiar languages and frameworks to easily deploy and manage applications and container workloads on {product-title}.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project].
The main components are:

Knative Serving:: Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes and Kourier to support deploying, managing and serving applications.
+
It creates a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are used to define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

Knative Eventing:: Knative Eventing enables developers to more easily declare how components of their system communicate using an event-driven architecture.
+
Event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers. For more information about event-driven architecture, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[What is event-driven architecture?]

{ServerlessProductName} provides a Knative CLI, `kn`, that allows you to quickly and easily complete Knative-related tasks. You can also complete developer or administrator tasks using the {product-title} web console after {ServerlessProductName} is installed.

== Common use cases of {ServerlessProductName}

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers
* Viewing point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations
* Routing and managing traffic
* Scaling automatically and sizing workloads based on demand
* Binding running services to eventing ecosystems

== Supported Configurations

The set of supported features, configurations, and integrations for {ServerlessProductName} (current and past versions) are available at the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4912821[Supported Configurations page].

== Next steps
* Cluster administrators can install {ServerlessProductName} by first installing the {ServerlessOperatorName}, then installing the Knative Serving and Knative Eventing components. For more information about installations, see the documentation on xref:../serverless/admin_guide/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#installing-openshift-serverless[Installing {ServerlessProductName}].
* After {ServerlessProductName} has been installed on your {product-title} cluster, you can modify the configuration of your {ServerlessProductName} deployment. See the _Administrator guide_ or the _Developer guide_ for more information, depending on your cluster permissions.
