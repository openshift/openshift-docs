Metrics enable cluster administrators to monitor how {ServerlessProductName} cluster components and workloads are performing.

[id="prerequisites_serverless-admin-metrics"]
== Prerequisites

* See the {product-title} documentation on xref:../../monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[Managing metrics] for information about enabling metrics for your cluster.
* To view metrics for Knative components on {product-title}, you need cluster administrator permissions, and access to the web console *Administrator* perspective.

[WARNING]
====
If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/serverless-ossm-setup.html#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Integrating Service Mesh with OpenShift Serverless].
