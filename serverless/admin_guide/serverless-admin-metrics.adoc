== Prerequisites

* See the {product-title} documentation on xref:../../monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#managing-metrics[Managing metrics] for information about enabling metrics for your cluster.
* To view metrics for Knative components on {product-title}, you need cluster administrator permissions, and access to the web console *Administrator* perspective.

[WARNING]
====
If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see the xref:../../serverless/serverless-release-notes.adoc#serverless-rn-1-16-0_serverless-release-notes[Serverless 1.16.0 release notes].
