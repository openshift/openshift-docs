The {ServerlessOperatorName} manages the global configuration of a Knative installation, including propagating values from the `KnativeServing` and `KnativeEventing` custom resources to system link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/[config maps].

Any updates to config maps which are applied manually are overwritten by the Operator. However, modifying the Knative custom resources allows you to set values for these config maps.

Knative has multiple config maps that are named with the prefix `config-`.

All Knative config maps are created in the same namespace as the custom resource that they apply to. For example, if the `KnativeServing` custom resource is created in the `knative-serving` namespace, all Knative Serving config maps are also created in this namespace.

The `spec.config` in the Knative custom resources have one `<name>` entry for each config map, named `config-<name>`, with a value which is be used for the config map `data`.

.Examples of global configuration

You can specify that the `KnativeServing` custom resource uses the `config-domain` config map  as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  config:
    domain: <1>
      example.org: |
        selector:
          app: prod
      example.com: ""
```
<1> Specifies the `config-domain` config map.

You can apply values to multiple config maps. This example sets `stable-window` to 60s in the `config-autoscaler` config map, as well as specifying the `config-domain` config map:

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  config:
    domain: <1>
      example.org: |
        selector:
          app: prod
      example.com: ""
    autoscaler: <2>
      stable-window: "60s"
```
<1> Specifies the `config-domain` config map.
<2> Specifies the `stable-window` setting in the `config-autoscaler` config map.
