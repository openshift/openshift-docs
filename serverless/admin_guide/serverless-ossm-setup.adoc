Using {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} enables developers to configure additional networking and routing options.

The {ServerlessOperatorName} provides Kourier as the default ingress for Knative. However, you can use {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} whether Kourier is enabled or not. Integrating with Kourier disabled allows you to configure additional networking and routing options that the Kourier ingress does not support.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of {SMProductName} functionality that is explicitly documented in this guide, and does not support other undocumented features.

== Integrating {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} natively

Integrating {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} natively, without Kourier, allows you to use additional networking and routing options that are not supported by the default Kourier ingress, such as mTLS functionality.

The examples in the following procedures use the domain `example.com`. The example certificate for this domain is used as a certificate authority (CA) that signs the subdomain certificate.

To complete and verify these procedures in your deployment, you need either a certificate signed by a widely trusted public CA or a CA provided by your organization. Example commands must be adjusted according to your domain, subdomain, and CA.

You must configure the wildcard certificate to match the domain of your {product-title} cluster. For example, if your {product-title} console address is `https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.example.com`, you must configure the wildcard certificate so that the domain is `*.apps.openshift.example.com`. For more information about configuring wildcard certificates, see the following topic about _Creating a certificate to encrypt incoming external traffic_.

If you want to use any domain name, including those which are not subdomains of the default {product-title} cluster domain, you must set up domain mapping for those domains. For more information, see the {ServerlessProductName} documentation about xref:../../serverless/security/serverless-custom-domains.adoc#serverless-create-domain-mapping_serverless-custom-domains[Creating a custom domain mapping].
