= Integrating {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName}
:context: serverless-ossm-setup

toc::[]

{ServerlessProductName} uses link:https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/06/30/kourier-a-lightweight-knative-serving-ingress[Kourier] as the default ingress for Knative. Kourier is a lightweight Knative Serving ingress that supports some limited features of {SMProductShortName}, such as JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

Kourier is useful if you want to use a lightweight ingress and you do not require most of the features of {SMProductShortName}. However, you can use {SMProductShortName} with {ServerlessProductName} to configure additional networking and routing options that the Kourier ingress does not support.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of {SMProductName} functionality that is explicitly documented in this guide, and does not support other undocumented features.

== About certificates and domains

The examples in the following procedures use the domain `example.com`. The example certificate for this domain is used as a certificate authority (CA) that signs the subdomain certificate.

To complete and verify these procedures in your deployment, you need either a certificate signed by a widely trusted public CA or a CA provided by your organization. Example commands must be adjusted according to your domain, subdomain, and CA.

You must configure the wildcard certificate to match the domain of your {product-title} cluster. For example, if your {product-title} console address is `https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.example.com`, you must configure the wildcard certificate so that the domain is `*.apps.openshift.example.com`. For more information about configuring wildcard certificates, see the following topic about _Creating a certificate to encrypt incoming external traffic_.

If you want to use any domain name, including those which are not subdomains of the default {product-title} cluster domain, you must set up domain mapping for those domains. For more information, see the {ServerlessProductName} documentation about xref:../../serverless/security/serverless-custom-domains.adoc#serverless-create-domain-mapping_serverless-custom-domains[Creating a custom domain mapping].
