If you have previously installed a Technology Preview version of {ServerlessProductName}, follow the instructions in this guide to upgrade to the latest version.

== Updating Knative services URL formats

When upgrading from older versions of {ServerlessProductName} to 1.7.0, support for HTTPS requires a change to the format of routes. Knative services created on {ServerlessProductName} 1.6.0 or older versions are no longer reachable at the old format URLs. You must retrieve the new URL for each service after upgrading {ServerlessProductName}.

For more information on retrieving Knative services URLs, see the documentation on xref:../../serverless/knative_serving/interacting-serverless-apps.adoc#interacting-serverless-apps[Interacting with your serverless application].
