This guide walks cluster administrators through installing the {ServerlessOperatorName} to an {product-title} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
{ServerlessProductName} is supported for installation in a restricted network environment. For more information, see xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[Using Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

== Additional requirements for advanced use cases

For more advanced use cases such as logging or metering on {product-title}, you must deploy more resources. Recommended requirements for such use cases are 24 CPUs and 96GB of memory.

If you have high availability (HA) enabled on your cluster, this requires between 0.5 - 1.5 cores and between 200MB - 2GB of memory for each replica of the Knative Serving control plane.
HA is enabled for some Knative Serving components by default. You can disable HA by following the documentation on xref:../../serverless/serverless-HA.adoc#serverless-HA[Configuring high availability replicas on {ServerlessProductName}].

[id="installing-openshift-serverless-scaling-with-machinesets"]
== Scaling your cluster using machine sets

You can use the {product-title} `MachineSet` API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size.
The minimum requirements usually mean that you must scale up one of the default machine sets by two additional machines.
See xref:../../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a machine set].

== Next steps

* After the {ServerlessOperatorName} is installed, you can install the Knative Serving component. See the documentation on xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/installing-knative-serving.adoc#installing-knative-serving[Installing Knative Serving].
* After the {ServerlessOperatorName} is installed, you can install the Knative Eventing component. See the documentation on xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/installing-knative-eventing.adoc#installing-knative-eventing[Installing Knative Eventing].
