If you have high availability (HA) enabled on your cluster, this requires between 0.5 - 1.5 cores and between 200MB - 2GB of memory for each replica of the Knative Serving control plane.

HA is enabled for some Knative Serving components by default. You can disable HA by following the documentation on xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/serverless-ha.adoc#serverless-ha[Configuring high availability replicas on {ServerlessProductName}].

== Scaling your cluster using machine sets

You can use the {product-title} `MachineSet` API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size.
The minimum requirements usually mean that you must scale up one of the default machine sets by two additional machines.
See xref:../../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a machine set].
