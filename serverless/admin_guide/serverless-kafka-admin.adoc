== Security configuration for Knative Kafka

Kafka clusters are generally secured by using the TLS or SASL authentication methods. You can configure a Kafka broker or channel to work against a protected Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster by using TLS or SASL.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you enable both SASL and TLS together.
