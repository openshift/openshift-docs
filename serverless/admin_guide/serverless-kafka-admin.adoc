Knative Kafka provides integration options for you to use supported versions of the Apache Kafka message streaming platform with {ServerlessProductName}. Kafka provides options for event source, channel, broker, and event sink capabilities.

In addition to the Knative Eventing components that are provided as part of a core {ServerlessProductName} installation, cluster administrators can install the `KnativeKafka` custom resource (CR).

[NOTE]
====
Knative Kafka is not currently supported for IBM Z and IBM Power Systems.
====

The `KnativeKafka` CR provides users with additional options, such as:

* Kafka source
* Kafka channel
* Kafka broker (Technology Preview)
* Kafka sink (Technology Preview)

== Security configuration for Knative Kafka

Kafka clusters are generally secured by using the TLS or SASL authentication methods. You can configure a Kafka broker or channel to work against a protected Red Hat AMQ Streams cluster by using TLS or SASL.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat recommends that you enable both SASL and TLS together.
