= High availability on {ServerlessProductName}
:context: serverless-ha

toc::[]

High availability (HA) is a standard feature of Kubernetes APIs that helps to ensure that APIs stay operational if a disruption occurs.
In an HA deployment, if an active controller crashes or is deleted, another controller is available to take over processing of the APIs that were being serviced by the controller that is now unavailable.

HA in {ServerlessProductName} is available through leader election, which is enabled by default after the Knative Serving or Eventing control plane is installed.

When using a leader election HA pattern, instances of controllers are already scheduled and running inside the cluster before they are required.
These controller instances compete to use a shared resource, known as the leader election lock.
The instance of the controller that has access to the leader election lock resource at any given time is referred to as the leader.

== Configuring high availability replicas on {ServerlessProductName}

High availability (HA) functionality is available by default on {ServerlessProductName} for Knative Serving, Knative Eventing, and Knative Kafka. These are the components scaled for each of them:

* Knative Serving: `activator`, `autoscaler`, `autoscaler-hpa`, `controller`, `webhook`, `kourier-control`, `kourier-gateway`.
* Knative Eventing: `eventing-controller`, `eventing-webhook`, `imc-controller`, `imc-dispatcher`, `mt-broker-controller`, `sugar-controller`.
* Knative Kafka: `kafka-ch-controller`, `kafka-controller-manager`, `kafka-webhook`.

These components are configured with two replicas by default.

For Knative Eventing, the `mt-broker-filter` and `mt-broker-ingress` deployments are not scaled by HA. If multiple deployments are needed, scale these components manually.

You modify the number of replicas that are created per component by changing the configuration of `spec.high-availability.replicas` in the KnativeServing custom resource (CR), the KnativeEventing CR, or the KnativeKafka CR.
// This field also specifies the minimum number of _activators_ if you are using the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA). For more information about HPA, see
