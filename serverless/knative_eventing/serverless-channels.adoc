It is possible to sink events from an Event Source to a Knative Eventing Channel.
Channels are custom resource (CRs) that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.
After events have been sent to a Channel, these Events can be sent to multiple Knative Services by using a Subscription.

The default configuration for Channel instances is defined in the `default-ch-webhook` ConfigMap. However, developers can still create their own channels directly by instantiating a supported Channel object.

== Supported Channel types

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of InMemoryChannel type Channels as part of the Knative Eventing Technology Preview.

The following are limitations of InMemoryChannel type Channels:

* No Event persistence is available. If a Pod goes down, Events on that Pod will be lost.
* InMemoryChannel type Channels do not implement Event ordering, so two Events that are received in the Channel at the same time may be delivered to a Subscription in any order.
* If a sink that is subscribed to a Subscription rejects an Event, there are no redelivery attempts. Instead, the rejected Event is sent to a _dead letter sink_ if this sink exists, or is otherwise dropped.
// TODO: Add link for dead letter sink docs once these are added.
