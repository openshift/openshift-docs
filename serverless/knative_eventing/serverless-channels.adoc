toc::[]

It is possible to sink events from an event source to a Knative Eventing channel.
Channels are custom resources (CRs) that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.
After events have been sent to a channel, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services by using a subscription.

The default configuration for channel instances is defined in the `default-ch-webhook` ConfigMap. However, developers can still create their own channels directly by instantiating a supported channel object.

== Supported channel types

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of InMemoryChannel type channels as part of the Knative Eventing Technology Preview.
