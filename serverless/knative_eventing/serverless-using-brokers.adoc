You can use an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] or a xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[SinkBinding], the `default` broker, and a trigger together to decouple applications that produce events from the destination configuration.

Events are sent from an event source to the broker as an HTTP POST request.
After events have entered the broker, they can be filtered and sent to an event sink by using triggers.
You can use a trigger to consume events from a broker based on event attributes. Your application will receive events as an HTTP POST request.

You can create the `default` broker by using the `knative-eventing-injection` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Although both developers and cluster administrators can add the `knative-eventing-injection` annotation, only cluster administrators can remove brokers created using this annotation.
