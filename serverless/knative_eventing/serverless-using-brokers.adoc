You can use an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] or a xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[SinkBinding], the `default` broker, and a trigger together to decouple applications that produce events from the destination configuration.

If you have cluster administrator permissions, you can create the `default` broker automatically using namespace annotation.

All other users must create a broker using the manual process as described in this guide.
