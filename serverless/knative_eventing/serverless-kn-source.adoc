 You can use `kn` to list and manage available event sources or event source types for use with Knative Eventing.
 For information about installing `kn`, see xref:../installing_serverless/installing-kn.adoc#installing-kn[Installing Knative client].

For more information about supported event source types, see xref:../knative_eventing/serverless-event-source-types.adoc#serverless-event-source-types[Event source types].

// Additional sources can be added by the cluster administrator. For example, {ServerlessProductName} can be used with Kafka and Camel K event sources, which are installed using the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console.
// For more information about adding event source types as a cluster administrator, see
// xref:../knative-client.adoc#knative-client[Installing Knative Client].
