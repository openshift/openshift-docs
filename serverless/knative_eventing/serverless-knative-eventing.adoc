Knative Eventing on {product-title} enables developers to more easily declare how components of their system communicate, using an event-driven architecture for serverless applications.

Event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers.

For more information about event-driven architecture, see link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[What is event-driven architecture?]

In a Knative Eventing workflow, event producers send information to an event source about changes to system state.
Examples of event producers include a Kafka cluster or the Kubernetes API server.
An event source is a resource object, which is the link between an event producer and a sink (or consumer) that receives those events.
Examples of sinks are Knative services and channels.
Events can also be sent to a broker, where they can be filtered using triggers before being sent to an event sink.

Using the broker and trigger together enables an event delivery mechanism that hides the details of event routing from the event producer and event consumer.
