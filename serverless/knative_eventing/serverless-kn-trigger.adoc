All events which are sent to a channel or broker will be sent to all subscribers of that channel or broker by default.

Using triggers allows you to filter events from a channel or broker, so that subscribers will only receive a subset of events based on your defined criteria.

The Knative CLI provides a set of `kn trigger` commands that can be used to create and manage triggers.

== Prerequisites
Before you can use triggers, you will need:

* Knative Eventing and `kn` installed.
* An available broker, either the `default` broker or one that you have created.
+
You can create the `default` broker either by following the instructions on xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[Using brokers with Knative Eventing], or by using the `--inject-broker` flag while creating a trigger. Use of this flag is described in the procedure below.
* An available event consumer, for example, a Knative service.

== Creating a trigger using `kn`

.Procedure

To create a trigger, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <name> --broker <BROKER-NAME> --filter <key=value> --sink <sink-name>
----

To create a trigger and also create the `default` broker using broker injection, enter the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ kn trigger create <name> --inject-broker --filter <key=value> --sink <sink-name>
----

.Example trigger YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: trigger-example <1>
spec:
 broker: default <2>
 subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service <3>
----

<1> The name of the trigger.
<2> The name of the broker where events will be filtered from. If the broker is not specified, the trigger will revert to using the `default` broker.
<3> The name of the service that will consumer filtered events.
