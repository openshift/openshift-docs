Metrics enable developers to monitor how Knative services are performing.

[id="prerequisites_serverless-metrics"]
== Prerequisites

* To view metrics for Knative components on {product-title}, you need access to the web console *Developer* perspective.

[WARNING]
====
If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/serverless-ossm-setup.adoc#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Integrating Service Mesh with OpenShift Serverless].
