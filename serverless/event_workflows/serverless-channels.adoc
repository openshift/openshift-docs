Channels are custom resources that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.

After events have been sent to a channel from an event source or producer, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services, or other sinks, by using a subscription.

// comment out for now - this information isn't necessary while only default channel type is available, and should be moved to an admin guide anyway.

== Creating channels

Developers can create channels by instantiating a supported `Channel` object.

[id="serverless-channels-connecting-sources"]
== Connecting a channel to an event source

Connecting a channel to an event source allows the channel to receive events from that source.
These events can then be forwarded to an event sink by using subscriptions.

== Creating subscriptions

Developers can create subscriptions that allow event sinks to subscribe to channels and receive events directly.
