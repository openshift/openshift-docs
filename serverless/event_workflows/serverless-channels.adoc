Channels are custom resources that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.

image::serverless-event-channel-workflow.png[Channel workflow overview]

After events have been sent to a channel from an event source or producer, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services, or other sinks, by using a subscription.

`InMemoryChannel` and `KafkaChannel` channel implementations can be used with {ServerlessProductName} for development use.

The following are limitations of `InMemoryChannel` type channels:

* No event persistence is available. If a pod goes down, events on that pod are lost.
* `InMemoryChannel` channels do not implement event ordering, so two events that are received in the channel at the same time can be delivered to a subscriber in any order.
* If a subscriber rejects an event, there are no re-delivery attempts by default. You can configure re-delivery attempts by modifying the `delivery` spec in the `Subscription` object.

== Connecting a channel to an event source

Connecting a channel to an event source allows the channel to receive events from that source.
These events can then be forwarded to an event sink by using subscriptions.
