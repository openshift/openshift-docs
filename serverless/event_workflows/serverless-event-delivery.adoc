You can configure event delivery parameters for Knative Eventing that are applied in cases where an event fails to be delivered by a xref:../../serverless/channels/serverless-subs.adoc#serverless-subs[subscription]. Event delivery parameters are configured individually per subscription.
// TODO: Update docs to add triggers once this is implemented.

== Configurable parameters

The following parameters can be configured for event delivery.

Dead letter sink:: You can configure the `deadLetterSink` delivery parameter so that if an event fails to be delivered it is sent to the specified event sink.

Retries:: You can set a minimum number of times that the delivery must be retried before the event is sent to the dead letter sink, by configuring the `retry` delivery parameter with an integer value.

Back off delay:: You can set the `backoffDelay` delivery parameter to specify the time delay before an event delivery retry is attempted after a failure. The duration of the `backoffDelay` parameter is specified using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations[ISO 8601] format.

Back off policy:: The `backoffPolicy` delivery parameter can be used to specify the retry back off policy. The policy can be specified as either `linear` or `exponential`. When using the `linear` back off policy, the back off delay is the time interval specified between retries. When using the `exponential` backoff policy, the back off delay is equal to `backoffDelay*2^<numberOfRetries>`.
