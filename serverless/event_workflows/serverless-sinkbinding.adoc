SinkBinding is used to connect event producers, or _event sources_, to an event consumer, or _event sink_, for example, a Knative service or application.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before developers can use a SinkBinding, cluster administrators must label the namespace that will be configured in the SinkBinding with `bindings.knative.dev/include:"true"`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <namespace> bindings.knative.dev/include=true
----
