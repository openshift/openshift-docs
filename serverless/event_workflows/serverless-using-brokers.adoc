Brokers can be used in combination with xref:../../serverless/event_workflows/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers-triggers[triggers] to deliver events from an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to an event sink.

Events can be sent from an event source to a broker as an HTTP POST request.

After events have entered the broker, they can be filtered by https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#context-attributes[CloudEvent attributes] using triggers, and sent as an HTTP POST request to an event sink.

== Creating a broker

{ServerlessProductName} provides a `default` Knative broker that can be created by using the Knative CLI.
You can also create the `default` broker by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection=enabled` label to a namespace if you are a cluster administrator, or by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation to a trigger if you are a developer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although both developers and cluster administrators can add a broker by injection, only cluster administrators can permanently delete brokers that were created using this method.

[id="serverless-using-brokers-managing-brokers"]
== Managing brokers

The `kn` CLI provides commands that can be used to list, describe, update, and delete brokers.
Cluster administrators can also permanently delete a broker that was created using injection.

== Filtering events using triggers

Using triggers enables you to filter events from the broker for delivery to event sinks.

.Prerequisites

Before you can use triggers, you will need:

* Knative Eventing and `kn` installed.
* An available broker, either the `default` broker or one that you have created.
+
You can create the `default` broker either by following the instructions on xref:../serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[Using brokers with Knative Eventing], or by using the `--inject-broker` flag while creating a trigger. Use of this flag is described later in this section.
* An available event consumer, such as a Knative service.
