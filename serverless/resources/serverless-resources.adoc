[id="serverless-resources-serving"]
== Knative Serving resources

Service:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` CRD automatically manages the life cycle of your workload to ensure that the application is deployed and reachable through the network. It creates a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each change to a user created service, or custom resource. Most developer interactions in Knative are carried out by modifying services.

Route:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` CRD maps a network endpoint to one or more revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Configuration:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` CRD maintains the desired state for your deployment. It provides a clean separation between code and configuration. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision.

[id="serverless-resources-eventing"]
== Knative Eventing resources

To enable delivery to multiple types of sinks, Knative Eventing defines the following generic interfaces that can be implemented by multiple Kubernetes resources:

Addressable resources:: Able to receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in the `status.address.url` field of the event. The Kubernetes `Service` resource also satisfies the addressable interface.

Callable resources:: Able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform it, returning `0` or `1` new events in the HTTP response payload. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed.
