toc::[]

Brokers can be used in combination with triggers to deliver events from an event source to an event sink. Events are sent from an event source to a broker as an HTTP `POST` request. After events have entered the broker, they can be filtered by CloudEvent attributes using triggers, and sent as an HTTP `POST` request to an event sink.
