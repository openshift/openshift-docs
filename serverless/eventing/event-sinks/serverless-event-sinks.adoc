When you create an event source, you can specify a sink where events are sent to from the source. A sink is an addressable or a callable resource that can receive incoming events from other resources. Knative services, channels and brokers are all examples of sinks.

Addressable objects receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in their `status.address.url` field. As a special case, the core Kubernetes `Service` object also fulfills the addressable interface.

Callable objects are able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform the event, returning `0` or `1` new events in the HTTP response. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed.

[TIP]
====
You can configure which CRs can be used with the `--sink` flag for Knative (`kn`) CLI commands by xref:../../../serverless/cli_tools/advanced-kn-config.adoc#advanced-kn-config[Customizing `kn`].
