Kafka sinks are a type of xref:./serverless-event-sinks.adoc#serverless-event-sinks[event sink] that are available if a cluster administrator has enabled Kafka on your cluster. You can send events directly from an xref:../event-sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to a Kafka topic by using a Kafka sink.
