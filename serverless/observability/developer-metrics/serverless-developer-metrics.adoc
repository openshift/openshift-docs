toc::[]

Metrics enable developers to monitor how Knative services are performing. You can use the {product-title} monitoring stack to record and view health checks and metrics for your Knative services.

You can view different metrics for {ServerlessProductName} by navigating to xref:../../../monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards-developer_reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[*Dashboards*] in the {product-title} web console *Developer* perspective.

[WARNING]
====
If {SMProductShortName} is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

ifndef::openshift-dedicated[]
For information about resolving this issue, see xref:../../../serverless/integrations/serverless-ossm-setup.adoc#serverless-ossm-enabling-serving-metrics_serverless-ossm-setup[Enabling Knative Serving metrics when using Service Mesh with mTLS].
endif::[]

Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
