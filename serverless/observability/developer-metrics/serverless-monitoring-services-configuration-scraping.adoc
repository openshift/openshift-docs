= Configuration for scraping custom metrics
:context: serverless-monitoring-services-configuration-scraping

Custom metrics scraping is performed by an instance of Prometheus purposed for user workload monitoring. After you enable user workload monitoring and create the application, you need a configuration that defines how the monitoring stack will scrape the metrics.

The following sample configuration defines the `ksvc` for your application and configures the service monitor. The exact configuration depends on your application and how it exports the metrics.
