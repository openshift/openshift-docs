Knative Client (`kn`) is the Knative command line interface (CLI).
The CLI exposes commands for managing your applications, as well as lower level tools to interact with components of {product-title}.
With `kn`, you can create applications and manage {product-title} projects from the terminal.

== Before you begin

Knative Client does not have its own log in mechanism.
To log in to the cluster you must install the `oc` CLI and use `oc` login.

Installation options for the `oc` CLI will vary depending on your operating system.
For more information on installing the `oc` CLI for your operating system and logging in with `oc`, see the xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[CLI getting started] documentation.
