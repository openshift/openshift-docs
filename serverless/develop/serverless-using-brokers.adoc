== Creating a broker that uses default settings

{ServerlessProductName} provides a `default` Knative broker that you can create by using the Knative (`kn`) CLI. You can also create the `default` broker by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation to a trigger, or by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection=enabled` label to a namespace.
