Knative provides a default, channel-based broker implementation. This channel-based broker can be used for development and testing purposes, but does not provide adequate event delivery guarantees for production environments.

If a cluster administrator has configured your {ServerlessProductName} deployment to use Kafka as the default broker type, creating a broker by using the default settings creates a Kafka-based broker.

If your {ServerlessProductName} deployment is not configured to use Kafka broker as the default broker type, the channel-based broker is created when you use the default settings in the following procedures.
