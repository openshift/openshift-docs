Brokers can be used in combination with xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[triggers] to deliver events from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to an event sink.

Events can be sent from an event source to a broker as an HTTP `POST` request. After events have entered the broker, they can be filtered by https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#context-attributes[CloudEvent attributes] using triggers, and sent as an HTTP `POST` request to an event sink.

== Creating a broker that uses default settings

{ServerlessProductName} provides a `default` Knative broker that you can create by using the `kn` CLI. You can also create the `default` broker by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection: enabled` annotation to a trigger, or by adding the `eventing.knative.dev/injection=enabled` label to a namespace.
