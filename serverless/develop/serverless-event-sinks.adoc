A sink is an addressable custom resource (CR) that can receive incoming events from other resources. Knative services, channels, and brokers are all examples of sinks.

[TIP]
====
You can configure which CRs can be used with the `--sink` flag for `kn` CLI commands by xref:../../serverless/cli_tools/advanced-kn-config.adoc#serverless-kn-config_advanced-kn-config[Customizing `kn`].
