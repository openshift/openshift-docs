The API server source is an event source that can be used to connect an event sink, such as a Knative service, to the Kubernetes API server. The API server source watches for Kubernetes events and forwards them to the Knative Eventing broker.

[id="prerequisites_serverless-apiserversource"]
== Prerequisites

* You must have a current installation of xref:../../serverless/install/install-serverless-operator.adoc#serverless-install-web-console_install-serverless-operator[{ServerlessProductName}], including Knative Serving and Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.
* Event sources need a service to use as an event _sink_. The sink is the service or application that events are sent to from the event source.
* You must create or update a service account, role and role binding for the event source.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the following procedures require you to create YAML files.

If you change the names of the YAML files from those used in the examples, you must ensure that you also update the corresponding CLI commands.
