In a Knative application, traffic can be managed by creating a traffic split. A traffic split is configured as part of a route, which is managed by a Knative service.

Configuring a route allows requests to be sent to different revisions of a service. This routing is determined by the `traffic` spec of the `Service` object.

A `traffic` spec declaration consists of one or more revisions, each responsible for handling a portion of the overall traffic. The percentages of traffic routed to each revision must add up to 100%, which is ensured by a Knative validation.

The revisions specified in a `traffic` spec can either be a fixed, named revision, or can point to the “latest” revision, which tracks the head of the list of all revisions for the service. The "latest" revision is a type of floating reference that updates if a new revision is created. Each revision can have a tag attached that creates an additional access URL for that revision.

The `traffic` spec can be modified by:

* Editing the YAML of a `Service` object directly.
* Using the `kn` CLI `--traffic` flag.
* Using the {product-title} web console.

When you create a Knative service, it does not have any default `traffic` spec settings.

== Traffic spec examples

The following example shows a `traffic` spec where 100% of traffic is routed to the latest revision of the service. Under `status`, you can see the name of the latest revision that `latestRevision` resolves to:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - latestRevision: true
    percent: 100
status:
  ...
  traffic:
  - percent: 100
    revisionName: example-service
----

The following example shows a `traffic` spec where 100% of traffic is routed to the revision tagged as `current`, and the name of that revision is specified as `example-service`. The revision tagged as `latest` is kept available, even though no traffic is routed to it:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - tag: current
    revisionName: example-service
    percent: 100
  - tag: latest
    latestRevision: true
    percent: 0
----

The following example shows how the list of revisions in the `traffic` spec can be extended so that traffic is split between multiple revisions. This example sends 50% of traffic to the revision tagged as `current`, and 50% of traffic to the revision tagged as `candidate`. The revision tagged as `latest` is kept available, even though no traffic is routed to it:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
...
  traffic:
  - tag: current
    revisionName: example-service-1
    percent: 50
  - tag: candidate
    revisionName: example-service-2
    percent: 50
  - tag: latest
    latestRevision: true
    percent: 0

# move this to services / apps docs eventually, also include diagram again there

Each time the configuration of a service is updated, a new revision for the service is created.

A revision is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to a Knative service. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as they are required or used. Knative Serving revisions can be automatically scaled up and down according to incoming traffic.
