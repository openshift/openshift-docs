Developers can create channels by instantiating a supported `Channel` object.

After you create a `Channel` object, a mutating admission webhook adds a set of `spec.channelTemplate` properties for the `Channel` object based on the default channel implementation.
For example, for an `InMemoryChannel` default implementation, the `Channel` object looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
spec:
  channelTemplate:
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
    kind: InMemoryChannel
----

[NOTE]
====
The `spec.channelTemplate` properties cannot be changed after creation, because they are set by the default channel mechanism rather than by the user.
====

The channel controller then creates the backing channel instance based on the `spec.channelTemplate` configuration.

When this mechanism is used with the preceding example, two objects are created: a generic backing channel and an `InMemoryChannel` channel. If you are using a different default channel implementation, the `InMemoryChannel` is replaced with one that is specific to your implementation. For example, with Knative Kafka, the `KafkaChannel` channel is created.

The backing channel acts as a proxy that copies its subscriptions to the user-created channel object, and sets the user-created channel object status to reflect the status of the backing channel.
