= Mapping a custom domain name to a Knative service
:context: serverless-domain-mapping

toc::[]

Knative services are automatically assigned a default domain name based on your cluster configuration. For example, `<service_name>.<namespace>.example.com`.

You can map a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service by creating a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) for the service. You can also create multiple CRs to map multiple domains and subdomains to a single service.
