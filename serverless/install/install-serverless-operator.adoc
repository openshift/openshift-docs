:context: install-serverless-operator

toc::[]

Installing the {ServerlessOperatorName} enables you to install and use Knative Serving, Knative Eventing, and Knative Kafka on a {product-title} cluster. The {ServerlessOperatorName} manages Knative custom resource definitions (CRDs) for your cluster and enables you to configure them without directly modifying individual config maps for each component.

[id="install-serverless-operator-scaling-with-machinesets"]
=== Scaling your cluster using machine sets

You can use the {product-title} `MachineSet` API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size. The minimum requirements usually mean that you must scale up one of the default machine sets by two additional machines. See xref:../../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a machine set].

// TODO: Add OSD specific docs for auto scaling machine sets? These docs aren't available for OSD so we need to look into what's required to doc here.
