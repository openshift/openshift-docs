== Scaling your cluster using machine sets

You can use the {product-title} `MachineSet` API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size.
The minimum requirements usually mean that you must scale up one of the default machine sets by two additional machines.
See xref:../../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a machine set].
