== Before you begin

Read the following information about supported configurations and prerequisites before you install {ServerlessProductName}.

* {ServerlessProductName} is supported for installation in a restricted network environment.

* {ServerlessProductName} currently cannot be used in a multi-tenant configuration on a single cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading to the latest Serverless release, you must remove the community Knative Eventing Operator if you have previously installed it. Having the Knative Eventing Operator installed prevents you from being able to install the latest version of Knative Eventing using the {ServerlessOperatorName}.

=== Scaling your cluster using machine sets

You can use the {product-title} `MachineSet` API to manually scale your cluster up to the desired size. The minimum requirements usually mean that you must scale up one of the default machine sets by two additional machines. See xref:../../machine_management/manually-scaling-machineset.adoc#manually-scaling-machineset[Manually scaling a machine set].
