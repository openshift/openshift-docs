You can add Kubernetes annotations to a deployed Serverless function by adding them to the `annotations` section in the `func.yaml` configuration file.

There are two limitations of the function annotation feature:

* After a function annotation propagates to the corresponding Knative service on the cluster, it cannot be removed from the service by deleting it from the `func.yaml` file. You must remove the annotation from the Knative service by modifying the YAML file of the service directly, or by using the {product-title} web console.

* You cannot set annotations that are set by Knative, for example, the `autoscaling` annotations.
