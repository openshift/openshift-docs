* {ServerlessProductName} is installed on your cluster.
* The xref:../../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[`oc` CLI] is installed on your cluster.
* The xref:../../serverless/installing-kn.adoc#installing-kn[Knative (`kn`) CLI] is installed on your cluster. Installing the `kn` CLI enables the use of `kn func` commands which you can use to create and manage functions.
* You have installed Docker Container Engine or podman, and have access to an available image registry.
* If you are using link:https://quay.io/[Quay.io] as the image registry, you must ensure that either the repository is not private, or that you have followed the {product-title} documentation on xref:../../openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.adoc#images-allow-pods-to-reference-images-from-secure-registries_using-image-pull-secrets[Allowing pods to reference images from other secured registries].
