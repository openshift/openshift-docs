[id="serverless-support-gather-info"]
== Gathering diagnostic information for support

When opening a support case, it is helpful to provide debugging
information about your cluster to Red Hat Support.

The `must-gather` tool enables you to collect diagnostic information about your
{product-title} cluster, including data related to
{ServerlessProductName}.

For prompt support, supply diagnostic information for both {product-title}
and {ServerlessProductName}.
