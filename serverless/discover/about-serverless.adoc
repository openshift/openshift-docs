{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs (Knative Serving and Eventing), as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.
