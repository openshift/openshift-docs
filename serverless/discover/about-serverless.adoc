{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs (Knative Serving and Eventing), as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

// Knative Serving
include::modules/about-knative-serving.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

// Knative Eventing
include::modules/about-knative-eventing.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

You can propagate an event from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../../serverless/discover/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[channels] and subscriptions, or
* xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[brokers] and xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[triggers].

// add something about CLI tools?
