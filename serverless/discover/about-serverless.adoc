toc::[]

{ServerlessProductName} provides Kubernetes native building blocks that enable developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications on {product-title}. {ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

[NOTE]
====
Because {ServerlessProductName} releases on a different cadence from {product-title}, the {ServerlessProductName} documentation does not maintain separate documentation sets for minor versions of the product. The current documentation set applies to all currently supported versions of {ServerlessProductName} unless version-specific limitations are called out in a particular topic or for a particular feature.

For additional information about the {ServerlessProductName} life cycle and supported platforms, refer to the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift#ossrvless[Platform Life Cycle Policy].

You can propagate an event from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../../serverless/discover/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[Channels and subscriptions], or
* xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[Brokers] and xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[Triggers].

// add something about CLI tools?
