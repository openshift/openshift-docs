{ServerlessProductName} provides Kubernetes native building blocks that enable developers to create and deploy serverless, event-driven applications on {product-title}. {ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

// Knative Eventing

You can propagate an event from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../../serverless/discover/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[Channels and subscriptions], or
* xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[Brokers] and xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[Triggers].

// add something about CLI tools?

== Scalability and performance

{ServerlessProductName} has been tested with a configuration of 3 main nodes and 3 worker nodes, each of which has 64 CPUs, 457 GB of memory, and 394 GB of storage each.

The maximum number of Knative services that can be created using this configuration is 3,000. This corresponds to the xref:../../scalability_and_performance/planning-your-environment-according-to-object-maximums.adoc#cluster-maximums-major-releases_object-limits[{product-title} Kubernetes services limit of 10,000], since 1 Knative service creates 3 Kubernetes services.

The average scale from zero response time was approximately 3.4 seconds, with a maximum response time of 8 seconds, and a 99.9th percentile of 4.5 seconds for a simple Quarkus application. These times might vary depending on the application and the runtime of the application.
