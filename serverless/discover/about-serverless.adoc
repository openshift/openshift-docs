Serverless is a cloud computing model where application developers do not need to provision servers or manage scaling for their applications. These routine tasks are abstracted away by the platform, allowing developers to push code to production more quickly than in traditional models.

{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs, as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.
