{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs (Knative Serving and Eventing), as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source link:https://knative.dev/docs/[Knative project], which provides portability and consistency for hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

== Supported configurations

The set of supported features, configurations, and integrations for {ServerlessProductName}, current and past versions, are available at the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4912821[Supported Configurations page].

[id="about-serverless-serving"]
== Knative Serving

Knative Serving on {product-title} enables developers to write link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native applications] using link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless[serverless architecture].

Knative Serving supports deploying and managing cloud-native applications. It provides a set of objects as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

Developers use these CRDs to create custom resource (CR) instances that can be used as building blocks to address complex use cases. For example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.

[id="about-serverless-eventing"]
== Knative Eventing

Knative Eventing on {product-title} enables developers to use an link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[event-driven architecture] with serverless applications.

An event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers and event consumers. Event producers create events, and event  xref:../../serverless/develop/serverless-event-sinks.adoc#serverless-event-sinks[_sinks_], or consumers, receive events.

Knative Eventing uses standard HTTP POST requests to send and receive events between event producers and sinks. These events conform to the link:https://cloudevents.io[CloudEvents specifications], which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language.

Knative Eventing supports the following use cases:

Publish an event without creating a consumer:: You can send events to a broker as an HTTP POST, and use binding to decouple the destination configuration from your application that produces events.

Consume an event without creating a publisher:: You can use a trigger to consume events from a broker based on event attributes. The application receives events as an HTTP POST.
