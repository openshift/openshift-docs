Service:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` CRD automatically manages the life cycle of your workload to ensure that the application is deployed and reachable through the network. It creates a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each change to a user created service, or custom resource. Most developer interactions in Knative are carried out by modifying services.

Revision:: The `revision.serving.knative.dev` CRD is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as necessary.

Route:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` CRD maps a network endpoint to one or more revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Configuration:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` CRD maintains the desired state for your deployment. It provides a clean separation between code and configuration. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision.
