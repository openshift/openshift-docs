To enable delivery to multiple types of sinks, Knative Eventing defines the following generic interfaces that can be implemented by multiple Kubernetes resources:

Addressable resources:: Able to receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in the `status.address.url` field of the event. The Kubernetes `Service` resource also satisfies the addressable interface.

Callable resources:: Able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform it, returning `0` or `1` new events in the HTTP response payload. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed.

You can propagate an event from an xref:../../serverless/discover/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../../serverless/discover/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[channels] and subscriptions, or
* xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[brokers] and xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-triggers.adoc#serverless-triggers[triggers].
