Knative components build on top of Kubernetes, abstracting away the complex details and enabling developers to focus on what matters. Built by codifying the best practices shared by successful real-world implementations, Knative solves the "boring but difficult" parts of deploying and managing cloud native services so you don't have to.

Key features:

* Stand up scalable, secure, stateless services in seconds.
* Focused API with higher level abstractions for common app use-cases.
* Pluggable components let you bring your own logging and monitoring, networking, and service mesh.
* Run Knative anywhere Kubernetes runs, never worry about vendor lock-in.
* Seamless developer experience.
* Supports many common tools and frameworks.
