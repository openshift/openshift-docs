[NOTE]
====
`kn` does not have its own login mechanism. To log in to the cluster, you must install the `oc` CLI and use `oc` login.

Installation options for the `oc` CLI will vary depending on your operating system.

For more information on installing the `oc` CLI for your operating system and logging in with `oc`, see the xref:../cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.adoc#cli-getting-started[OpenShift CLI getting started] documentation.
