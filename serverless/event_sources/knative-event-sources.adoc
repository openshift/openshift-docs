An _event source_ is an object that links an event producer with an event _sink_, or consumer. A sink can be a Knative service, channel, or broker that receives events from an event source.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.
SinkBinding:: Allows you to connect core Kubernetes resource objects such as a `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` with a sink.
KafkaSource:: Connect a Kafka cluster to a sink as an event source.

You can create and manage Knative event sources using the **Developer** perspective in the {product-title} web console, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.
