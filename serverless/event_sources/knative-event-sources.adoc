A Knative _event source_ can be any Kubernetes object that generates or imports cloud events, and relays those events to another endpoint, known as a xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-event-sinks.adoc#serverless-event-sinks[_sink_]. Sourcing events is critical to developing a distributed system that reacts to events.

You can create and manage Knative event sources by using the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-apiserversource.adoc#serverless-apiserversource[API server source]:: Brings Kubernetes API server events into Knative. The API server source fires a new event each time a Kubernetes resource is created, updated or deleted.

xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-pingsource.adoc#serverless-pingsource[Ping source]:: Produces events with a fixed payload on a specified cron schedule.

xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-kafka-source.adoc#serverless-kafka-source[Kafka source]:: Connects a Kafka cluster to a sink as an event source.

You can also create a xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-custom-event-sources.adoc#serverless-custom-event-sources[custom event source].
