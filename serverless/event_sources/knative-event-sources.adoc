An _event source_ is a resource object that acts as a link between an event producer and a _sink_. A sink can be a Knative service, channel or broker that receives events from an event source.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.

SinkBinding is also supported, which allows you to connect core Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` with a sink.

You can create and manage Knative event sources using the Developer perspective, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a current installation of xref:../../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#serverless-install-web-console_installing-openshift-serverless[{ServerlessProductName}], including Knative Serving and Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.
* Event sources need a service to use as an event _sink_. The sink is the service or application that events are sent to from the event source.
// TODO: Create a better section about adding serverless apps/Knative services, group kn + dev console etc as I am doing now for event sources. This content should be reusable in Serverless and Dev Console docs.

== Creating event sources

* Create an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-apiserversource.adoc#serverless-apiserversource[ApiServerSource].
// add others

== Additional resources
* For more information about eventing workflows using {ServerlessProductName}, see xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-knative-eventing.adoc#serverless-knative-eventing[How Knative Eventing works].
