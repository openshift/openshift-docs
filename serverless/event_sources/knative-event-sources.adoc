An _event source_ is an object that links an event producer with an event _sink_, or consumer. A sink can be a Knative service, channel, or broker that receives events from an event source.

[id="knative-event-sources-creating"]
== Creating event sources

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

API server source:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server by creating an `APIServerSource` object.
Ping source:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. A ping source can be used as a timer, and is created as a `PingSource` object.

xref:../../serverless/event_workflows/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[Sink binding] is also supported, which allows you to connect core Kubernetes resources such as `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` with a sink.

You can create and manage Knative event sources using the **Developer** perspective in the {product-title} web console, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.
