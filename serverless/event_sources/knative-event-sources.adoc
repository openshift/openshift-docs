An _event source_ is an object that links an event producer with an event _sink_, or consumer. A sink can be a Knative Service, Channel, or Broker that receives events from an event source.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following Event Source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping Events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.

xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[SinkBinding] is also supported, which allows you to connect core Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Job, or StatefulSet with a sink.

You can create and manage Knative event sources using the **Developer** perspective in the {product-title} web console, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.

.Prerequisites

* You must have a current installation of xref:../../serverless/installing_serverless/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#serverless-install-web-console_installing-openshift-serverless[{ServerlessProductName}], including Knative Serving and Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.
