An _event source_ is an object that links an event producer with an event _sink_, or consumer. A sink can be a Knative Service, Channel, or Broker that receives events from an event source.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.

xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[SinkBinding] is also supported, which allows you to connect core Kubernetes resources such as Deployment, Job, or StatefulSet with a sink.

You can create and manage Knative event sources using the **Developer** perspective in the {product-title} web console, the `kn` CLI, or by applying YAML files.

== Prerequisites

* You must have a current installation of xref:../../serverless/getting_started/installing-openshift-serverless.adoc#serverless-install-web-console_installing-openshift-serverless[{ServerlessProductName}], including Knative Serving and Eventing, in your {product-title} cluster. This can be installed by a cluster administrator.
* Event sources need a service to use as an event _sink_. The sink is the service or application that events are sent to from the event source.
// TODO: Create a better section about adding serverless apps/Knative services, group kn + dev console etc as I am doing now for event sources. This content should be reusable in Serverless and Dev Console docs.

== Creating event sources

* Create an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-apiserversource.adoc#serverless-apiserversource[ApiServerSource].
* Create an xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-pingsource.adoc#serverless-pingsource[PingSource].
// add others
