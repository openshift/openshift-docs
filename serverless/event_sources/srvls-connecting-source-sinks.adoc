When you xref:../../serverless/event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[create an event source], you can specify a sink where events are sent to from the source. A sink is an addressable resource that can receive incoming events from other Knative Eventing resources. Knative services, channels, and brokers are all examples of sinks.
