== Using a container source to create your own event source

The container source custom resource allows you to specify a container image, arguments, and sink information, which are passed to a receive adapter. This adapter is controlled by the Knative Eventing controller, enabling you to implement your own event source without the need to create or maintain a separate Kubernetes controller.
