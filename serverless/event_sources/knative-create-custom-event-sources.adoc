toc::[]

When you create a Knative event source, the event source must conform to the Knative event sources spec. The following components are required for a functioning event source:

* A controller that runs the event source and reconciles the underlying receive adapter deployments.
* A receive adapter which generates or imports events, and translates them into CloudEvent format if this is required, before sending them to a specified sink.
* A series of identifying characteristics for the event (duck types?).
* Transporting a valid event to the serverless system for further processing.
// last two are questionable; part of spec/function of adapter and controller?

// how EXACTLY does someone create an adapter and WHAT is it, CRD, YAML??
// how does a user configure it?
// eventing dev exposes the source CRD -> passes config to the adapter via the controller

////
API Resources required:

    KubeClientSet.Appsv1.Deployment (Inherited via the Eventing base reconciler) Used to deploy the Receive Adapter for "importing" events
    EventingClientSet.EventingV1Alpha1 (Inherited via the Eventing base reconciler) Used to interact with Events within the Knative system
    SourceClientSet.SourcesV1Alpha1 Used for source — in this case, samplesource — specific config and translated to the underlying deployment (via the inherited KubeClientSet)

// Talk about eventing-sources-controller

You can create your own event source by using any of the following methods:

- Use a xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-containersource.adoc#serverless-containersource[container source] to create an event source from an existing container image.
- Use a xref:../../serverless/event_sources/serverless-sinkbinding.adoc#serverless-sinkbinding[sink binding].
- Create an event source from scratch, which requires you to create a receive adapter, a controller, and a webhook. This method is the most advanced, and is not recommended for less experienced Kubernetes users.

[NOTE]
====
The container source and sink binding methods are appropriate for developer use, however controllers can only be created and maintained by a cluster administrator.
