If you need to ingress events from an event producer that is not included in Knative, or from a producer that emits events which are not in the `CloudEvent` format, you can do this by using one of the following methods:

* Use a `PodSpecable` object as an event source, by creating a _sink binding_.
* Use a container as an event source, by creating a _container source_.

== Using a container source

Container sources create a container image that generates events and sends events to a sink. You can use a container source to create a custom event source, by creating a container image and a `ContainerSource` object that uses your image URI.
