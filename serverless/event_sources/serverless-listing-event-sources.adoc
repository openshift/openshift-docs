You can use the `kn` CLI or the *Developer* perspective in the {product-title} web console to list and manage available event sources or event source types.

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} supports the following event source types:

API server source:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
Ping source:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.
Sink binding:: Connects core Kubernetes resource objects, such as `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` objects, with a sink.
Container source:: Creates a custom event source by using an image.
Knative Kafka source:: Connects a Kafka cluster to a sink as an event source.
