A PingSource is used to periodically send ping events with a constant payload to an event consumer.

A PingSource can be used to schedule sending events, similar to a timer, as shown in the example:

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1alpha2
kind: PingSource
metadata:
  name: test-ping-source
spec:
  schedule: "*/2 * * * *" <1>
  jsonData: '{"message": "Hello world!"}' <2>
  sink: <3>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display
----

<1> The schedule of the event specified using https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/#schedule[CRON expression].
<2> The event message body expressed as a JSON encoded data string.
<3> These are the details of the event consumer. In this example, we are using a Knative service named `event-display`.
