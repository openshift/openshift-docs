= Configuring a custom domain for a Knative service
:context: serverless-custom-domains
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Knative services are automatically assigned a default domain name based on your cluster configuration. For example, `<service_name>.<namespace>.example.com`.

You can customize the domain for your Knative service by using one of the following methods:

* Configure the service as a private service and create the required {ProductShortName} resources.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
This method of configuring custom domains is only supported for clusters that have Kourier enabled. If you want to configure custom domains using only {ServerlessProductName} with {ProductShortName}, without Kourier enabled, use the `DomainMapping` resources method instead.
====
* Map a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service by creating a `DomainMapping` resource for the service. You can also create multiple `DomainMapping` resources to map multiple domains and subdomains to a single service.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use `DomainMapping` resources to map custom domains either with or without Kourier enabled in your cluster, however TLS is not supported in clusters that have both Kourier and domain mapping enabled.

== Configuring custom domains for private Knative services

You can configure a custom domain for an existing Knative service by completing the following procedures.

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* {ProductName} version 1.x or 2.x is installed on your cluster, and the integration between {ProductName} and {ServerlessProductName} has been correctly configured.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of {ProductName} functionality that is explicitly documented in this guide, and does not support other undocumented features.
