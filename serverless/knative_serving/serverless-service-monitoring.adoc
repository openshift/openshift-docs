You can use the {product-title} monitoring stack to record and view health checks and metrics for your Knative services. This section describes the following topics:

* What metrics Knative services expose by default
* How to configure exposing custom metrics
* How to configure the monitoring stack to scrape the exposed metrics
* How to view the metrics of a service

[NOTE]
====
Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
