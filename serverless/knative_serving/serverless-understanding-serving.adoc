Knative Serving on {product-title} enables developers to write link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native applications] using link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless[serverless architecture].

Knative Serving supports deploying and managing cloud-native applications by providing a set of objects as Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster. For more information about CRDs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc#crd-extending-api-with-crds[Extending the Kubernetes API with custom resource definitions].

Developers use these CRDs to create custom resource (CR) instances that can be used as building blocks to address complex use cases. For example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
// TODO: Add other use cases, more advanced tutorials?

For more information about CRs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.adoc#crd-managing-resources-from-crds[Managing resources from Custom Resource Definitions].

Service:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` CRD automatically manages the life cycle of your workload to ensure that the application is deployed and reachable through the network. It creates a route, a configuration, and a new revision for each change to a user created service, or custom resource. Most developer interactions in Knative are carried out by modifying services.

Revision:: The `revision.serving.knative.dev` CRD is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as necessary.

Route:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` CRD maps a network endpoint to one or more revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Configuration:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` CRD maintains the desired state for your deployment. It provides a clean separation between code and configuration. Modifying a configuration creates a new revision.
