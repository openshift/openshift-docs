Knative leverages {product-title} TLS termination to provide routing for Knative services. When a Knative service is created, a {product-title} route is automatically created for the service. This route is managed by the {ServerlessOperatorName}. The {product-title} route exposes the Knative service through the same domain as the {product-title} cluster.

You can disable Operator control of {product-title} routing so that you can configure a Knative route to directly use your TLS certificates instead.

Knative routes can also be used alongside the {product-title} route to provide additional fine-grained routing capabilities, such as traffic splitting.
