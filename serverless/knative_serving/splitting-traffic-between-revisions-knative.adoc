With each update to the configuration of a service, a new revision for the service is created. The service route points all traffic to the latest ready revision by default. You can change this behavior by defining which revisions gets a portion of the traffic.

Knative services allow for traffic mapping, which means that revisions of a service can be mapped to an allocated portion of traffic. Traffic mapping also provides an option to create unique URLs for particular revisions.
