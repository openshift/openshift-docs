= Configuring Transport Layer Security for a custom domain using {ProductName} and Kourier
:context: serverless-ossm-tls
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

You can create a Transport Layer Security (TLS) key and certificates for a custom domain and subdomain using {ProductName}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of {ProductName} functionality that is explicitly documented in this guide, and does not support other undocumented features.

== Prerequisites

* Install xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/install-serverless-operator.adoc#install-serverless-operator[{ServerlessProductName}].
* Install {ProductName} xref:../../service_mesh/v1x/installing-ossm.adoc#installing-ossm-v1x[1.x] or xref:../../service_mesh/v2x/installing-ossm.adoc#installing-ossm-v2x[2.x].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} is compatible only with full implementations of either {ProductName} 1.x or 2.x. {ServerlessProductName} does not support custom usage of some 1.x resources and some 2.x resources in the same deployment. For example, upgrading to 2.x while still using the control plane `maistra.io/v1` spec is not supported.
====
* Complete the configuration steps in xref:../../serverless/admin_guide/serverless-ossm-setup.adoc#serverless-ossm-setup-with-kourier_serverless-ossm-setup[Integrating {ProductShortName} and {ServerlessProductName} with Kourier enabled].
* Configure a custom domain. See xref:../../serverless/knative_serving/serverless-custom-domains.adoc#serverless-custom-domains[Configuring a custom domain for a Knative service].
* In this example, `openssl` is used to generate certificates, but you can use any certificate generation tool to create these.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This example uses the `example.com` domain.
The example certificate for this domain is used as a certificate authority (CA) that signs the subdomain certificate.

To complete and verify this procedure in your deployment, you need either a certificate signed by a widely trusted public CA, or a CA provided by your organization.

Example commands must be adjusted according to your domain, subdomain and CA.
