====
If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.

For information about resolving this issue, see the xref:../../serverless/serverless-release-notes.adoc#serverless-rn-1-16-0_serverless-release-notes[Serverless 1.16.0 release notes].
