If you have installed a previous version of {ServerlessProductName}, follow the instructions in this guide to upgrade to the latest version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before upgrading to the latest Serverless release, you must remove the community Knative Eventing Operator if you have previously installed it. Having the Knative Eventing Operator installed prevents you from being able to install the latest version of Knative Eventing using the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
