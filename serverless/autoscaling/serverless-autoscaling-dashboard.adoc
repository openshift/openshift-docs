You can use the *Knative Serving - Scaling Debugging* dashboard to examine detailed and visualized data for Knative Serving autoscaling. The dashboard is useful for several purposes:

* Troubleshooting your autoscaled workloads
* Improving understanding of how autoscaling works
* Determining why an application was autoscaled
* Evaluating resource footprint of an application, such as number of pods

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, this dashboard only supports the Knative pod autoscaler (KPA). It does not support the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA).
====

The dashboard demonstrations in this section use an {product-title} cluster with the `autoscale-go` sample application installed. The load is generated using the `hey` load generator.

The sample application has a concurrency limit of 5 requests. When the limit is exceeded, autoscaling requests additional pods for Knative from Kubernetes.
