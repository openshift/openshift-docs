Set the autoscaler parameters around pods and concurrency limits in this section.

Min Pods

The lower limit for the number of Pods that can be set by autoscaler. If not specified defaults to 0.

// serverless-autoscaling-minscale.adoc

Max Pods

The upper limit for the number of Pods that can be set by autoscaler.

Concurrency target

Defines how many concurrent requests are wanted per instance of the Application at a given time (soft limit) and is the recommended configuration for autoscaling. If not specified, will be defaulted to the value set in the Cluster config.

Concurrency limit

Limits the amount of concurrent requests allowed into one instance of the Application at a given time (hard limit), and is configured in the revision template. If not specified, will be defaulted to the value set in the Cluster config.

Concurrency utilization

Percentage of concurrent requests utilization before scaling up.

Autoscale window

Duration to look back for making auto-scaling decisions. The service is scaled to zero if no request was received in during that time.
