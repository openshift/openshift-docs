Knative Serving provides automatic scaling, or _autoscaling_, for applications to match incoming demand. For example, if an application is receiving no traffic, and scale to zero is enabled, Knative Serving scales the application down to zero replicas. If scaling to zero is disabled, the application is scaled down to the minimum number of replicas specified for applications on the cluster. Replicas can also be scaled up to meet demand if traffic to the application increases.

[id="serverless-autoscaling-how-it-works"]
== How autoscaling works

After a defined time of idleness called the `stable-window`, a revision is considered inactive. All routes pointing to the now inactive revision are pointed to the activator instead. This reprogramming of the network is asynchronous in nature, so the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` should give enough slack for this to happen. Once the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` is over, the revision is scaled to zero replicas. By default, the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` is 30 seconds, and the `stable-window` is 60 seconds.

If another request is sent to this revision, the activator receives it, instructs the autoscaler to create new pods for the revision as quickly as possible, and buffers the request until those new pods are created.

By default Knative Serving allows 100 concurrent requests into a pod. This is defined by the `container-concurrency-target-default` setting in the `config-autoscaler` config map in the `knative-serving` namespace. If you set a concurrency value by using annotations in the service YAML, you can override the default concurrency setting.
