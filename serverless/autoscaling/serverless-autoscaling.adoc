Knative Serving provides automatic scaling, or _autoscaling_, for applications to match incoming demand. For example, if an application is receiving no traffic, and scale to zero is enabled, Knative Serving scales the application down to zero pods. If scaling to zero is disabled, the application is scaled down to the minimum number of pods specified for applications on the cluster. Pods can also be scaled up to meet demand if traffic to the application increases.

To enable autoscaling for Knative Serving, you must configure xref:../autoscaling/serverless-autoscaling-concurrency.adoc#serverless-autoscaling-concurrency[concurrency] and xref:../autoscaling/serverless-autoscaling-scale-bounds.adoc#serverless-autoscaling-scale-bounds[scale bounds] for your application.

[NOTE]
====
Any limits or targets set in the revision template are measured against a single instance of your application. For example, setting the `target` annotation to `50` configures the autoscaler to scale the application so that each revision handles 50 requests at a time.
