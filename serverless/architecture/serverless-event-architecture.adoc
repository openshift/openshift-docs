Knative Eventing on {product-title} enables developers to use an link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture[event-driven architecture] with serverless applications.
An event-driven architecture is based on the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers that create events, and event  _sinks_, or consumers, that receive them.

Knative Eventing uses standard HTTP POST requests to send and receive events between event producers and consumers.
These events conform to the link:https://cloudevents.io[CloudEvents specifications], which enables creating, parsing, sending, and receiving events in any programming language.

You can propagate an event from an xref:../event_sources/knative-event-sources.adoc#knative-event-sources[event source] to multiple event sinks by using:

* xref:../event_workflows/serverless-channels.adoc#serverless-channels[channels] and subscriptions, or
* xref:../event_workflows/serverless-using-brokers.adoc#serverless-using-brokers[brokers] and triggers.

Events are buffered if the destination sink is unavailable.
// For more information about creating an Event delivery system, see
// Add link to getting started or tutorial landing page for eventing
Knative Eventing supports the following scenarios:

Publish an event without creating a consumer:: You can send events to a broker as an HTTP POST, and use a SinkBinding to decouple the destination configuration from your application that is producing events.
Consume an event without creating a publisher:: You can use a trigger to consume events from a broker based on event attributes. Your application will receive events as an HTTP POST.
// Use Channels and Subscriptions to define complex message-passing topologies:: For simple pipelines, the Sequence automates construction of Channels and Subscriptions between each stage.
// Knative also supports some additional patterns such as Parallel fanout of events, and routing response events from both Channels and Brokers

== Event sinks

To enable delivery to multiple types of sinks, Knative Eventing defines the following generic interfaces that can be implemented by multiple Kubernetes resources:

Addressable objects:: Able to receive and acknowledge an event delivered over HTTP to an address defined in the event's `status.address.url` field. The Kubernetes Service object also satisfies the addressable interface.
Callable objects:: Able to receive an event delivered over HTTP and transform it, returning 0 or 1 new events in the HTTP response payload. These returned events may be further processed in the same way that events from an external event source are processed.
