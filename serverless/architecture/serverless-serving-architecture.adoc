Knative Serving on {product-title} enables developers to write link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps[cloud-native applications] using link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless[serverless architecture].
Serverless is a cloud computing model where application developers don't need to provision servers or manage scaling for their applications. These routine tasks are abstracted away by the platform, allowing developers to push code to production much faster than in traditional models.

Knative Serving supports deploying and managing cloud-native applications by providing a set of objects as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster. For more information about CRDs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/crds/crd-extending-api-with-crds.adoc#crd-extending-api-with-crds[Extending the Kubernetes API with Custom Resource Definitions].

Developers use these CRDs to create custom resource (CR) instances that can be used as building blocks to address complex use cases. For example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
// TODO: Add other use cases, more advanced tutorials?

For more information about CRs, see xref:../../operators/understanding/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.adoc#crd-managing-resources-from-crds[Managing resources from Custom Resource Definitions].

Service:: The `service.serving.knative.dev` CRD automatically manages the life cycle of your workload to ensure that the application is deployed and reachable through the network. It creates a Route, a Configuration, and a new Revision for each change to a user created Service, or custom resource. Most developer interactions in Knative are carried out by modifying Services.

Revision:: The `revision.serving.knative.dev` CRD is a point-in-time snapshot of the code and configuration for each modification made to the workload. Revisions are immutable objects and can be retained for as long as necessary.

Route:: The `route.serving.knative.dev` CRD maps a network endpoint to one or more Revisions. You can manage the traffic in several ways, including fractional traffic and named routes.

Configuration:: The `configuration.serving.knative.dev` CRD maintains the desired state for your deployment. It provides a clean separation between code and configuration. Modifying a configuration creates a new Revision.
