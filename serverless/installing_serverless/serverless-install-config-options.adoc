This guide provides information for cluster administrators about advanced installation configuration options for Knative Serving and Knative Eventing.

The YAML configuration is shown by default when you are creating the Knative Serving or Knative Eventing custom resource definitions. However, you can access the form view by selecting *Edit Form* in the top right corner of the *Create Knative Serving* or *Create Knative Eventing* pages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not modify any YAML contained inside the `config` field. Some of the configuration values in this field are injected by the {ServerlessOperatorName}, and modifying them will cause your deployment to become unsupported.

=== Controller Custom Certs

If your registry uses a self-signed certificate, you must enable tag-to-digest resolution by creating a ConfigMap or Secret.
The {ServerlessOperatorName} then automatically configures Knative Serving controller access to the registry.

To enable tag-to-digest resolution, the Knative Serving controller requires access to the container registry.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The ConfigMap or Secret must reside in the same namespace as the Knative Serving custom resource definition.
====

The following example triggers the {ServerlessOperatorName} to:

. Create and mount a volume containing the certificate in the controller.
. Set the required environment variable properly.

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
  namespace: knative-serving
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: certs
    type: ConfigMap
----

The following example uses a certificate in a ConfigMap named `certs` in the `knative-serving` namespace.

You can also configure controller custom certs using the form view.
The supported types are `ConfigMap` and `Secret`.

If no controller custom cert  is specified, this defaults to the `config-service-ca` ConfigMap.

.Example default YAML
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  controller-custom-certs:
    name: config-service-ca
    type: ConfigMap
----

=== High availability

High availability (HA) defaults to 2 replicas per controller if no number of replicas is specified.

You can set this to `1` to disable HA, or add more replicas by setting a higher integer.

For more information about configuring HA, see xref:../serverless-HA.adoc#serverless-HA[High availability on {ServerlessProductName}].

.Example YAML
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  high-availability:
    replicas: 2
