If you have previously installed a Technology Preview version of {ServerlessProductName}, follow the instructions in this guide to upgrade to the latest version.

In {ServerlessProductName} versions 1.5.0 and older, the only available Subscription Update Channel was `techpreview`.
To upgrade to the latest version, you must update the channel to `preview-4.3`.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed a Technology Preview version of {ServerlessOperatorName}, and have selected Automatic updates during the installation process.
* If you have selected Manual updates, you will need to complete additional steps after updating the channel as described in this guide. The Subscription’s upgrade status will remain *Upgrading* until you review and approve its Install Plan.
For details, see the {product-title} documentation on xref:../../operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.adoc#olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster[adding Operators to a cluster].

.Procedure

. Select the `openshift-operators` namespace in the {product-title} web console.
. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators* → *Installed Operators* page.
. Select the *{ServerlessOperatorName} Operator*.
. Click *Subscription* → *Channel*.
. In the *Change Subscription Update Channel* window, select `preview-4.3`, and click *Save*.
. Wait until all pods have been upgraded in the `knative-serving` namespace, and the `KnativeServing` custom resource reports the latest Knative Serving version.

.Verifying the upgrade

To verify that the upgrade has been successful, you can check the status of pods in the `knative-serving` namespace, and the version of the `KnativeServing` CR.

. Check the status of the pods by entering the command:
+
```
oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving '-o=jsonpath={.status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status}
```
+
It should return a status of `True`.
. Check the version of the `KnativeServing` CR by entering the following command:
+
```
oc get knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving '-o=jsonpath={.status.version}
```
+
It should return the latest version of Knative Serving.
