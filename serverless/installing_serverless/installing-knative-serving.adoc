Knative Serving on {product-title} builds on Kubernetes and Kourier to support deploying and serving serverless applications.

It creates a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are used to define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

These CRDs are building blocks to address complex use cases, for example:

* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
* Viewing point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations.

After you install the {ServerlessOperatorName}, you can install Knative Serving by following the procedures described in this guide.

// Create Serving project + namespace
