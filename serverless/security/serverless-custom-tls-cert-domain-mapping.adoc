You can use an existing TLS certificate with a `DomainMapping` custom resource (CR) to secure the mapped service.

.Prerequisites

* You have completed the steps in xref:../../serverless/security/serverless-custom-domains.adoc#serverless-custom-domains[Configuring a custom domain for a Knative service], and have a working `DomainMapping` CR.

* You have a TLS certificate from your Certificate Authority provider, or a self-signed certificate.

* You have obtained the `cert` and `key` files from your Certificate Authority provider, or a self-signed certificate.

.Procedure

. Create a Kubernetes TLS secret:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <tls_secret_name> --cert=<path_to_certificate_file> --key=<path_to_key_file>
----

. Update the `DomainMapping` CR to use the TLS secret you have created:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
  name: <domain_name>
  namespace: <namespace>
spec:
  ref:
    name: <service_name>
    kind: Service
    apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
# TLS block specifies the secret to be used
  tls:
    secretName: <tls_secret_name>
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `DomainMapping` CR status is `True`, and that the `URL` column of the output shows the mapped domain with the scheme `https`:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get domainmapping <domain_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----
NAME                      URL                               READY   REASON
example.com               https://example.com               True
----

. Optional: If the service is exposed publicly, verify that it is available by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl https://<domain_name>
----
+
If the certificate is self-signed, skip verification by adding the `-k` flag to the `curl` command.
