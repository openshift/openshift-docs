= Configuring a custom domain for a Knative service
:context: serverless-custom-domains
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

Knative services are automatically assigned a default domain name based on your cluster configuration. For example, `<service_name>.<namespace>.example.com`.

You can customize the domain for your Knative service by mapping a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service, by creating a `DomainMapping` resource for the service. You can also create multiple `DomainMapping` resources to map multiple domains and subdomains to a single service.

:FeatureName: Configuring custom domains for private Knative services

[IMPORTANT]
====
{FeatureName} is a deprecated feature. Deprecated functionality is still included in {product-title} and continues to be supported; however, it will be removed in a future release of this product and is not recommended for new deployments.

Refer to xref:../../serverless/security/serverless-custom-domains.adoc#serverless-create-domain-mapping_serverless-custom-domains[Creating a custom domain mapping] for the latest documentation.
====

:!FeatureName:

You can configure a custom domain for an existing Knative service by completing the following procedures.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This method of configuring custom domains is only supported for clusters that have Kourier enabled. If you want to configure custom domains using only {ServerlessProductName} with {ProductShortName}, without Kourier enabled, use the `DomainMapping` resources method instead.
====

.Prerequisites

* The {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving are installed on your {product-title} cluster.
* {ProductName} version 1.x or 2.x is installed on your cluster, and the integration between {ProductName} and {ServerlessProductName} has been correctly configured.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of {ProductName} functionality that is explicitly documented in this guide, and does not support other undocumented features.
