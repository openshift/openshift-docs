== About {PM-shortname}

{PM-title-c} enables monitoring power consumption of various components, such as CPU and DRAM for each container running in an {OCP} cluster. It helps monitor power usage and identify power-consuming containers.
{PM-shortname-c} deploys {PM-Kepler} (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter), a metrics exporter that uses eBPF to collect energy-related system statistics and export them. {PM-kepler} provides granular power consumption data for Kubernetes pods, namespaces, and nodes.
