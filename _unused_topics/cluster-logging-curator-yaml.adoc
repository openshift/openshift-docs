= Deleting Curator Indices

You can configure Elasticsearch Curator to delete indices.

.Prerequisite

Set cluster logging to the unmanaged state. In managed state, the Cluster Logging Operator reverts changes made to the `logging-curator` configuration map.

.Procedure

To delete indices:

. Edit the {product-title} custom Curator configuration file:

----
$ oc edit configmap config.yaml
----

. Set the following parameters as needed:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE

$PROJECT_NAME:
  $ACTION:
    $UNIT: $VALUE
 ...

----

The available parameters are:

|===
|Variable Name
|Description

|`PROJECT_NAME`
|The actual name of a project, such as *myapp-devel*. For {product-title} *operations*
logs, use the name `.operations` as the project name.

|`ACTION`
|The action to take, currently only `delete` is allowed.

|`UNIT`
|The period to use for deletion, `days`, `weeks`, or `months`.

|`VALUE`
|The number of units.

|`.defaults`
|Use `.defaults` as the `$PROJECT_NAME` to set the defaults for projects that are
not specified.

|`.regex`
|The list of regular expressions that match project names.

|`pattern`
|The valid and properly escaped regular expression pattern enclosed by single
quotation marks.

|===

For example, to configure Curator to:

- Delete indices in the *myapp-dev* project older than `1 day`
- Delete indices in the *myapp-qe* project older than `1 week`
- Delete *operations* logs older than `8 weeks`
- Delete all other projects indices after they are `31 days` old
- Delete indices older than 1 day that are matched by the '^project\..+\-dev.*$' regex
- Delete indices older than 2 days that are matched by the '^project\..+\-test.*$' regex

Use:

[source,yaml]
----
config.yaml: |
  myapp-dev:
    delete:
      days: 1

  myapp-qe:
    delete:
      weeks: 1

  .operations:
    delete:
      weeks: 8

  .defaults:
    delete:
      days: 31

  .regex:
    - pattern: '^project\..+\-dev\..*$'
      delete:
        days: 1
    - pattern: '^project\..+\-test\..*$'
      delete:
        days: 2
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you use `months` as the `$UNIT` for an operation, Curator starts counting at
the first day of the current month, not the current day of the current month.
For example, if today is April 15, and you want to delete indices that are 2 months
older than today (delete: months: 2), Curator does not delete indices that are dated
older than February 15; it deletes indices older than February 1. That is, it
goes back to the first day of the current month, then goes back two whole months
from that date. If you want to be exact with Curator, it is best to use days
(for example, `delete: days: 30`).
