[id="builds-output-image-digest_{context}"]
= Output image digest

Built images can be uniquely identified by their digest, which can
later be used to pull the image by digest regardless of its current tag.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
`Docker` and
endif::[]
`Source-to-Image (S2I)` builds store the digest in
`Build.status.output.to.imageDigest` after the image is pushed to a registry.
The digest is computed by the registry. Therefore, it may not always be present,
for example when the registry did not return a digest, or when the builder image
did not understand its format.
