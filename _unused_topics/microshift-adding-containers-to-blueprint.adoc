= Adding the {product-title} container images

You can embed {product-title}'s container images into the {op-system-ostree} images so that they are immediately available to the CRI-O container engine after booting. Embedded container images are not pulled over the network from a container registry. In Image Builder, a container image is embedded by adding a reference to it to the Image Builder blueprint.

The following syntax must be used to add a configuration section to the blueprint file. You can then add your the container image to embed in the {op-system-ostree} image.

.Example syntax for adding a container image to a blueprint

.Prerequisites

* You have installed jq.

.Procedure

You must have the exact list of container image references used by the {product-title} version to embed {product-title}'s container images. Use the `microshift-release-info` RPM package matching the version of the `microshift` RPM in your blueprint. Use the following procedure.

. Download the `microshift-release-info` RPM package matching your {product-title} version by running the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ VERSION=$(sudo yum list | awk "/^microshift\./ {print \$2;}")
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ yum download microshift-release-info-${VERSION}
----

. Extract the release info by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ rpm2cpio microshift-release-info-${VERSION}.noarch.rpm | cpio -idmv
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-aarch64.json
./usr/share/microshift/release/release-x86_64.json
----

. Generate the lines to append to your blueprint using the release info for your CPU architecture by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ jq -r '.images | .[] | ("[[containers]]\nsource = \"" + . + "\"\n")' ./usr/share/microshift/release/release-$(uname -m).json
