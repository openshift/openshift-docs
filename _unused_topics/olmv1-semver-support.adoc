[id="olmv1-semver-support_{context}"]
= Support for semantic versioning

{olmv1-first} supports link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning (semver)] when explicitly enabled. Cluster extension authors can use the semver standard to define compatible updates.

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} 4.16, {olmv1} uses {olmv0} semantics by default.
====

{olmv1} can use an extension's version number to determine if an update can be resolved successfully.

Cluster administrators can define a range of acceptable versions to install and automatically update. For extensions that follow the semver standard, you can use comparison strings to specify a desired version range.

[NOTE]
====
{olmv1} does not support automatic updates to the next major version. If you want to perform a major version update, you must verify and apply the update manually. For more information, see "Forcing an update or rollback".
