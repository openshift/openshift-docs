= Sample YAML for a Cluster API infrastructure cluster resource on {aws-full}

The infrastructure cluster resource is provider-specific and defines properties that all the compute machine sets in the cluster share, such as the region and subnets.
The compute machine set references this resource when creating machines.

In {product-title} {product-version}, the {cluster-capi-operator} generates this resource.
The following sample YAML file is for informational purposes.
User modification of this generated resource is not recommended.
