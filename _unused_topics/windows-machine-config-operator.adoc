= Windows Machine Config Operator

[discrete]
== Purpose

The Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) orchestrates the process of deploying and managing Windows workloads on a cluster. The WMCO configures Windows machines into compute nodes, enabling Windows container workloads to run in {product-title} clusters. This is done by creating a machine set that uses a Windows image with the Docker-formatted container runtime installed. The WMCO completes all necessary steps to configure the underlying Windows VM so that it can join the cluster as a compute node.
