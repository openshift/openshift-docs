= Performing administrative Elasticsearch operations

An administrator certificate, key, and CA that can be used to communicate with and perform administrative operations on Elasticsearch are provided within the *elasticsearch* secret in the `openshift-logging` project.

[NOTE]
====
To confirm whether your OpenShift Logging installation provides these, run:
----
$ oc describe secret elasticsearch -n openshift-logging
----
====

. Connect to an Elasticsearch pod that is in the cluster on which you are attempting to perform maintenance.

. To find a pod in a cluster use:
+
----
$ oc get pods -l component=elasticsearch -o name -n openshift-logging  | head -1
----

. Connect to a pod:
+
----
$ oc rsh <your_Elasticsearch_pod>
----

. Once connected to an Elasticsearch container, you can use the certificates mounted from the secret to communicate with Elasticsearch per its link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/indices.html[Indices APIs documentation].
+
Fluentd sends its logs to Elasticsearch using the index format *infra-00000x* or *app-00000x*.
+
For example, to delete all logs for the openshift-logging index, *app-000001*, we can run:
+
----
$ curl --key /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-key \
--cert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-cert \
--cacert /etc/elasticsearch/secret/admin-ca -XDELETE \
"https://localhost:9200/app-000001"
