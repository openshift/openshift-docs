= Java overview

{product-title} provides a source-to-image (S2I) builder image for building Java applications. This builder image takes your application source or binary artifacts, builds the source using Maven if a source was provided, and assembles the artifacts with any required dependencies to create a new, ready-to-run image containing your Java application. This resulting image can be run on {product-title}.

The builder image is intended for use with link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven]-based Java standalone projects that are run with main class.
