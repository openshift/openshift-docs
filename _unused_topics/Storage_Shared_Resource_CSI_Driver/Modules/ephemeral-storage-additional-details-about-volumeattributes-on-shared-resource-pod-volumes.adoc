= Additional details about VolumeAttributes on shared resource pod volumes

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Shared Resource CSI Driver feature is now generally available in link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/builds_for_red_hat_openshift/1.1[{builds-v2title} 1.1]. This feature is now deprecated in {product-title}. To use this feature, ensure you are using {builds-v2title} 1.1 or a more recent version.

[role="_abstract"]
The following attributes affect shared resource pod volumes in various ways:

* The `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttributes` properties.
* The `refreshResources` attribute in the Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration.
* The `sharedSecret` and `sharedConfigMap` attributes in the `volumeAttributes` properties.

== The `refreshResource` attribute

The Shared Resource CSI Driver honors the `refreshResource` attribute in `volumeAttributes` properties of the volume. This attribute controls whether updates to the contents of the underlying `Secret` or `ConfigMap` object are copied to the volume *after* the volume is initially provisioned as part of pod startup. The default value of `refreshResource` is `true`, which means that the contents are updated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration has disabled the refreshing of both the shared `SharedSecret` and `SharedConfigMap` custom resource (CR) instances, then the `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttribute` properties has no effect. The intent of this attribute is to disable refresh for specific volume mounts when refresh is generally allowed.
====

== The `refreshResources` attribute

You can use a global switch to enable or disable refreshing of shared resources. This switch is the `refreshResources` attribute in the `csi-driver-shared-resource-config` config map for the Shared Resource CSI Driver, which you can find in the `openshift-cluster-csi-drivers` namespace. If you set this `refreshResources` attribute to `false`, none of the `Secret` or `ConfigMap` object-related content stored in the volume is updated after the initial provisioning of the volume.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Using this Shared Resource CSI Driver configuration to disable refreshing affects all the cluster's volume mounts that use the Shared Resource CSI Driver, regardless of the `refreshResource` attribute in the `volumeAttributes` properties of any of those volumes.
====

== Validation of volumeAttributes before provisioning a shared resource volume for a pod

In the `volumeAttributes` of a single volume, you must set either a `sharedSecret` or a `sharedConfigMap` attribute to the value of a `SharedSecret` or a `SharedConfigMap` CS instance. Otherwise, when the volume is provisioned during pod startup, a validation checks the `volumeAttributes` of that volume and returns an error to the kubelet under the following conditions:

* Both `sharedSecret` and `sharedConfigMap` attributes have specified values.
* Neither `sharedSecret` nor `sharedConfigMap` attributes have specified values.
* The value of the `sharedSecret` or `sharedConfigMap` attribute does not correspond to the name of a `SharedSecret` or `SharedConfigMap` CR instance on the cluster.
