//=== Manually configuring OVS bridge br-ex
//.Procedure
//Manually configure the OVS bridge br-ex by running the following commands.

//* Initiate OVS:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ sudo systemctl enable openvswitch --now
//----
//* Add the network bridge:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br-ex
//----
//* Add the interface to the network bridge:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br-ex <physical-interface-name>
//----
//The `<physical-interface-name>` is the network interface name where the node IP address is assigned.
//* Get the bridge up and running:
//+
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ sudo ip link set br-ex up
//----
//* After `br-ex up` is running, assign the node IP address to `br-ex` bridge:
//[source,terminal]
//----
//$ sudo ...
//----
//[NOTE]
//Adding a physical interface to `br-ex` bridge will disconnect the ssh connection on the node IP address.
